      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Process Dashboard is a powerful and
      flexible tool for software process automation, released under
      the terms of the GNU General Public License. By automating and
      simplifying metrics collection and analysis, the Process
      Dashboard makes it easier to use high-maturity processes such as
      the Personal Software Process<sup>(SM)</sup>.
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Process Dashboard also makes it
      easy to apply high-maturity behaviors to everyday tasks, even if
      those tasks do not use any defined process. Dashboard features
      such as the &quot;Task and Schedule&quot; tool can help anyone
      to plan and track their daily work more effectively.</p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Process Dashboard contains an
      embedded process engine which provides unprecedented integration
      of metrics data with process scripts, forms, and other
      documents. This engine reads process definitions as simple XML,
      HTML, and text files, and provides a user interface which helps
      individuals to use the process.

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because process definitions are not
      hard-coded into the Dashboard, anyone can create a new process
      definition to use with the dashboard. Ready-made process
      definitions can also be installed if desired.</p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Process Dashboard is written in
      the Java<sup>(TM)</sup> programming language, and can run on
      many platforms, such as Windows&nbsp;&reg;, Unix,
      Linux<sup>(TM)</sup>, and Mac OS&nbsp;&reg; X.</p>
