Errors.Version_Incompatibility.Title=Data Version Incompatibility
Errors.Version_Incompatibility.Header=\
    This Process Dashboard dataset makes use of functionality\n\
    that was introduced in:
Errors.Version_Incompatibility.Item_FMT={0} version {1}
Errors.Version_Incompatibility.Upgrade_Message=\
    Unfortunately, you are running an older version of the\n\
    software.  You must upgrade before you can open this\n\
    dataset.
Errors.Version_Incompatibility.Missing_Message=\
    Unfortunately, you have not installed these package(s). You\n\
    must install them before you can open this dataset.


Errors.Corrupt_Statefile_Title=Cannot read hierarchy file
Errors.Corrupt_Statefile_Warning_FMT=\
    The dashboard was unable to open and read the file that\n\
    contains your hierarchy.  This problem could be caused by\n\
    insufficient file permissions, or by corrupt data in the\n\
    file itself.  This is a very serious problem; the dashboard\n\
    will not continue until the problem is corrected.  Please\n\
    examine the file:\n        \
        {1}\n\
    and correct the following error{2,choice,0#|1# on line {2}}:\n        \
        {0}\n\
    If you cannot correct this error, the only other course of\n\
    action is to rename or delete the file.  This effectively\n\
    will cause all your data to be lost.

Errors.JRE_Requirement_Title_FMT=JRE {0} Required
Errors.JRE_Requirement_Message_FMT=\
    You need to upgrade your Java Runtime Environment!  This\n\

Errors.Broken_Data_Title=Missing Data Files
Errors.Broken_Data_Header=\
	Missing files are preventing the dashboard from opening the\n\
	data for the following projects/tasks\:
Errors.Broken_Data_Footer=\
	The most likely cause of this problem is that you created\n\
	the above projects/tasks based on an add-on process set,\n\
	then deleted the file containing that add-on process set.\n\
	If you use add-on process sets located in a network directory,\n\
	this problem could also occur when the network is unavailable.\n\
	The recommended course of action is to shut down the\n\
	dashboard, reinstall the add-on process set, then restart the\n\
	dashboard.  Until you do this, the data for these\n\
	projects/tasks will be inaccessible and/or incomplete.

Errors.Missing_MCF.Title=Missing Metrics Collection Framework Module
Errors.Missing_MCF.Header_FMT=\
    The Process Dashboard is packaged and distributed in a modular way. The \
    main application provides a core foundation for planning, tracking, and \
    analysis. Then process-specific scripts, forms, and reports are bundled \
    into separate modules, which you can optionally choose to install.\n\
    \ \n\
    You have requested to open a dataset that includes projects based upon the \
    optional {0} module. Unfortunately, you have not installed that {0} module \
    onto this computer.\n\
    \ \n\
    As a result, the dashboard cannot display the scripts, forms, reports, or \
    data for the following project(s):
Errors.Missing_MCF.TSP_Footer=\
    To resolve this problem, please visit the [[[Process Dashboard download \
    page]]] and download the installer that contains "PSP and TSP Process \
    Extensions." After you run that installer, try opening this dataset again.
Errors.Missing_MCF.Custom_Footer_FMT=\
    To resolve this problem, please contact your team leader or coach and ask \
    for a copy of the "{0} metrics collection framework" module. (They can \
    follow [[[these instructions]]] to locate that file.)  Save that file into \
    the directory {1}, then try opening this dataset again.
Errors.Missing_MCF.Custom_Footer_Zip_FMT=\
    To resolve this problem, please contact the person who gave you this Data \
    Backup file, and ask for a copy of the "{0} metrics collection framework" \
    module. (They can follow [[[these instructions]]] to locate that file.) \
    Save that file into the directory {1}, then try opening this dataset again.

    The dashboard was unable to open and read {0}:\n        \
        {1}\n\
    \ \n\
    This problem could be caused by insufficient file permissions,\n\

Errors.Save_Error.Message_FMT=\
	The dashboard was unable to save the following data:\n        \
        {0} \n\
	This problem could be caused by insufficient file permissions,\n\
	intermittent network problems, or other filesystem errors.  If\n\
	you leave the dashboard running, it will continue trying to save\n\
	this information.  If you shut down the dashboard now, this data\n\
	will be permanently lost.\n\
	\ \n\
	Are you certain you want to shut down the dashboard, and lose\n\
	this data?
Errors.Save_Error.Remote_Message=\
	The dashboard was unable to contact the server to save your recent\n\
	changes.  This problem could be caused by intermittent network\n\
	connectivity or other communications problems.\n\
	\ \n\
	If you leave the dashboard running, it will continue trying to save\n\

Errors.Lost_Lock.Opening_Message=\
	Although you opened the dashboard in read-write mode, your\n\
	connection to the network was broken, and your lock on the data\n\
	was lost.  In the meantime, another individual has opened this\n\

Errors.Lost_Lock.Ongoing_Advice=\
	As a result, recent changes you have made (and any changes you\n\
	continue to make while you have this dashboard open) cannot be\n\
	saved.  You are strongly encouraged to close and reopen the\n\
	dashboard.
Errors.Lost_Lock.Shutdown_Warning=\

    \ \n\
    Unfortunately, <a>some of these files</a> are read-only.  This\n\
