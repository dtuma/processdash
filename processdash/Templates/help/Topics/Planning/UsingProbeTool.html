<H1>Using the PROBE Tool</H1>

<p>When following PSP's PROBE process (as defined in the book
<i>A&nbsp;Self-Improvement Process for Software Engineers</i>), most people will want
to use the <a href="UsingProbeWizard.html">PROBE Wizard</a>.  It thoroughly
automates the PROBE process and helps you to avoid common mistakes.</p>

<p>However, the PROBE Wizard is specifically designed for the correlations
described in the PSP process scripts.  If you thoroughly understand the
linear regression calculations, the PROBE tool can offer more flexibility.
The PROBE Tool will allow you to explore the correlations between any pair
of metrics, not just the pairs described in the PROBE process.  The PROBE
tool can be opened by selecting 
&quot;Tools&nbsp;<img src="../../Images/rarrow.png">&nbsp;PROBE&quot; from the
<a href="../Execution/ConfigureMenu.html">configuration menu</a>.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/ProbeToolStart.png"></p>

<p>If you wish to explore the correlations of the standard PROBE data
pairs, the Method pull-down allows quick access to them.  Clicking on the
pull-down gives the following choices:</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/ProbeToolMethods.png"></p>

<P>Choosing any of the standard PROBE methods will set the independent and
dependent variables to their appropriate values.  If you would like to
explore correlations between any two other process metric variables, they
can be chosen from the independent and dependent variable pull-downs.</p>

<P><a name="average"></a><a name="regression"></a>Basically the PROBE 
tool runs a correlation test on the two sets of data chosen.  It then reports 
the various statistical measurements on the dialog.  There are two types of 
measurements shown on the dialog: those that show relationships between the 
sets of data chosen (r<sup>2</sup>, p, Variance, Standard Deviation), and 
those that are related to a projection based on the estimate entered 
(<i>B</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>B</i><sub>1</sub>, Range, UPI and LPI).  Also there 
are two columns of data on the tool.  The left column shows data based on a 
linear regression (this is for methods A and B the PROBE estimation method) 
and the right column shows data based on how well your data seem to predict 
on the average (this is for the different C methods of the PROBE estimation 
method).</p> 

<a name="probeDialogFilter"></a><h2>Filtering your data set</h2>
<P>The filter button allows you to restrict the data set of the correlation 
and projection to certain projects.  It will pop up a tree view of the 
current projects stored and allow you to add or remove data items from the 
selected set.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/ProbeFilter.png"></p>

<p>Seleted items are marked with a graphical "X".  By default the tool only 
shows projects in the tree (nodes).  You can expand this view to include the 
process phases as well by choosing the "Show leaf nodes" box.  This will 
allow you to include or reject data from among different phases of projects.  
The Apply button applies your filtering selection to the numbers in the PROBE 
dialog.</p> 

<h2>Measures of correlation</h2>
<P>On a typical estimation, you will want to choose from the different 
combinations of correlations available to see if any of the data correlate 
well enough to be used for projections.  The PROBE tool will make this quite 
simple.  Just pick the two data sets you would like to correlate, and the 
numbers on the tool will update to show you the results. The key numbers to 
examine are the measure of correlation (r<sup>2</sup>) and the significance 
measurement (p).</p>

<a name="correlation"></a><h3>The correlation measurement</h3>
<p>As detailed by Watts Humphrey, an r<sup>2</sup> value of over 0.5 
indicates that the numbers correlate well enough to use a linear regression 
method.  The degree of confidence as measured by the r<sup>2</sup> variable 
is shown on the dialog by its color.  When the value is too low to be used 
for predictive purposes, the r<sup>2</sup> value will show up in red.  Values 
that show better and better agreement are shown in different colors.  The 
colors used are: red (very bad), yellow/orange (fair), blue (good), and black 
(very good).</p>

<a name="significance"></a><h3>The significance measurement</h3>
<p>The significance measurement is an indication of how significant the 
correlation is.  It is expressed in a percentage that represents the 
probability that this correlation could have happened by chance.  Low numbers 
mean that the data is probably showing a causality and can be used to make 
projections.  The same color scheme to show the relative "goodness" of the 
data is used here.</p>

<P>Both measures need to be taken into consideration before using a 
projection from a linear correlation.  There are some data combinations that 
can make one of the measurements look good while the other is bad.  For 
example if you have data that correlate well but the significance of that 
correlation is not very high, you could be looking at a random occurrence.</p>

<a name="interval"></a><a name="projection"></a><h2>Making a projection</h2>
<P>To make a projection, just enter an estimate in the Estimate entry.  The 
estimate should be an estimate of the type of data that is chosen in the top 
pull down box marked "Correlate".  For example, you should put an estimated 
number of New &amp; Changed LOC in the entry if you are correlating against 
Estimated New &amp; Changed LOC.  The % range entry will allow you to change 
the confidence interval of the projection.  Most PSP work is done at a 70% 
confidence interval, but you can set this as high or as low as you would 
like.  Setting the confidence interval higher will give you a wider range of 
possible values, and setting the interval lower will narrow the range of 
possible values.</p>

<P>As you change the input parameters, the tool will relcalculate all the
numbers appropriately.  Some calculations may display ERROR if the data is
poorly correlated, or if there are not enough historical data points to
perform the calculation.
The projected estimate will show up at the top of both columns (the left 
column showing the projection using linear regression and the right column 
showing the projection based on an averaging technique).  It is up to you to 
decide which numbers are appropriate for making the projection.</p>

<a name="probeDialogChart"></a><h2>Visualizing the data</h2>
<P>The PROBE tool also offers a scatterplot of your process data.  This view 
is chosen by clicking on the "Chart" button.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/ProbeChart.png"></p>

<P>The plot will show a scatterplot of the data being used for the regression 
calculations and two lines passing through the data.  A blue line shows the 
line as projected from <i>B</i><sub>0</sub> and <i>B</i><sub>1</sub> 
calculated using linear regression, and a red line shows the line as 
projected from the averaging calculation.  Only one of these lines will be in 
color if you've chosen one of the standard PROBE estimating methods.  In this 
case, the other line is shown in grey.  If you choose a custom estimation 
method (i.e. you are comparing different sets of data than what the PROBE 
method calls for) both lines will show in color.  Many times this visual 
representation of the data can provide insights that straight numbers may 
not.</p>

<P>The three columns below the plot display the actual values used for the 
data plotted.  The first column contains the project name, and the second and 
third columns show the data values for the X and Y axes respectively.</p>
