<H1>Localization Tool</H1>

<P>The dashboard has many users around the world.  To better support
all our users, we are currently working to internationalize the
dashboard.  The Process Dashboard includes a Localization Tool that
you can use to translate dashboard messages into your own language.
You can open the Localization Tool by selecting &quot;Tools&nbsp;<img
src="../../Images/rarrow.png">&nbsp;Localization Tool&quot; from the
<a href="../Execution/ConfigureMenu.html">configuration menu</a>.</P>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/LocalizationToolMenu.png"></p>

<P>(Note that the menu option for the localization tool will not
normally appear for English-speaking users.)  The Localization Tool is
based upon the useful Zaval JRC Editor written by Victor Krapivin and
others (<u>http://www.zaval.org/products/jrc-editor/</u>).</P>

<P>The localization tool arranges translation keys hierarchically and
displays the resulting tree on the left.  Exclamation points indicate
keys that still need to be translated.  When you select a key in this
tree, the right hand side of the screen displays the English message
and a place for translation into your native language.</P>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/LocalizationTool.png"></p>

<P>Some translation keys end with the string "_FMT".  The English
message associated with these keys will contain expressions like
"{0}".  These translation items are Java MessageFormat strings; at
runtime, the "{0}" will be replaced with a dynamically generated
value.  To translate these items correctly, you will need to
understand the syntax of MessageFormat strings.  For more information
on MessageFormat syntax, visit
<u>http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/java/text/MessageFormat.html</u></P>

<P>Other translations may contain cross-references.  A cross-reference
is a translation key surrounded by curly braces, with a '$' sign in
front; an example would be <tt>${some.other.key}</tt>.  When the
dashboard sees a cross-reference, it looks up the translation
described by the named key, and replaces the reference with that
translation.</P>

<P>Cross-references are designed to reduce the burden of translating
the dashboard, without sacrificing expressiveness.  For example, the
English word "Plan" may be used in two different places inside the
dashboard, but it may have different meanings (for example, in English
the word "Plan" might be used as a noun, a verb, or an adjective).  In
another language, different words might be needed to capture these
different meanings.  Thus, the dashboard might define the following
translation keys:
<PRE>     Plan=Plan
     Plan_Noun=${Plan}
     Plan_Verb=${Plan}
     Plan_Adjective=${Plan}</PRE>

This approach has two benefits.  If your language, like English,
reuses the same word in all these situations, then you will only need
to translate the "Plan" key, and the other three keys will follow
along automatically.  If, however, your language requires different
words for one or more of these situations, you can edit the other keys,
deleting the cross-reference entirely and entering your translation
instead.</P>

<P>After you enter translations, click on the Save icon.  Your new
translations will take effect the next time you restart the process
dashboard.</P>

<P>The localizations you enter will be saved automatically into a file
with a name like "pspdash_*.jar".  You can locate this file by visiting
<u>http://localhost:2468/control/showenv.class</u>. This file is formatted as a
<a href="../Overview/HowToInstall.html#addon">Process Dashboard Add-on</a>,
and can be easily shared with other dashboard users.  Give them a copy
of the file and instruct them to save it into the directory where they
installed the Process Dashboard, and they can benefit from your
translations as well.</P>

<P>If you choose to use the Localization Tool, please consider sharing
your translations with the Process Dashboard development team.  This
will allow users around the world to benefit from your translation
efforts.  The Localization Tool can share your translations
automatically if you give your consent.  (Note that automatic sharing
will not work if you have to use an HTTP proxy server to connect to
the internet.  No error message will be displayed in this case.  If
you would like to share translations, but you are behind an HTTP proxy
server, please send email to <u>processdash-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</u>
for further instructions.)</P>
