<H1>How To Install</H1>

<H2>System Requirements</H2>

<P>The Process Dashboard is 100% Java, and will run on any system with a Java 
2 compliant virtual machine. This includes Windows, Linux, Unix,
and Macintosh systems. For access to forms and scripts, a supported web
browser is also required.</p>

<P>To use the process dashboard, you must <b>first</b> install the following 
software:</P> 

<UL>
 <LI><a name="jre"></a>The Java Runtime Environment, version 1.6 or
   greater (available from Oracle at
   <u class="url">http://www.java.com/</u>)</li>

 <LI>Make certain that JavaScript is enabled in your web browser.
   (This is typically the default setting, so you usually don't need
   to worry about enabling these unless you explicitly disabled them
   in the past.)</li>

 <LI>If you connect to the internet via a proxy server, you may need to tell 
   your browser to bypass the proxy for the address "localhost". The 
   instructions below may not apply to your browser word-for-word, but should 
   hopefully get you pointed in the right direction:
  <UL>
   <LI>For Internet Explorer, choose &quot;Tools <IMG BORDER="0"
    SRC="../../Images/rarrow.png" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="9"> Internet 
      Options&quot;. Click on the "Connections" tab, then on the "LAN
      Settings" button. Make certain the "Bypass proxy server for
      local addresses" box is <B><STRONG>checked</STRONG></B>.</li>

   <LI>For Firefox, no changes are typically necessary.  If you have trouble
    viewing dashboard scripts and forms, open the Options dialog.  On the
    Advanced pane, choose the Network tab and click the button to configure
    settings for how Firefox connects to the Internet.  On that Connection
    Settings dialog, ensure that the "No Proxy for" box contains
    "localhost".</LI>

  </UL>

<H2>Installation Instructions:</H2>

<ol>

  <li>Before attempting to install the dashboard, make certain you
    have installed the required software listed above.  In particular,
    the Process Dashboard installer program will not run if you do not
    have the <a href="#jre">Java Runtime Environment</a> installed on
    your computer.</li>

  <li><a name="installer"></a>Download the Process Dashboard installer
    program from 
    <u class="url">http://www.processdash.com/download</u>
    and follow the directions found there.</li>

 <li>Please consider subscribing to our announcements mailing list. We will 
   send email to this mailing list when new versions of the tool are 
   available.  You can subscribe to the list at 
   <u class="url">http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/processdash-announce</u></li>

</ol>

<H2><A name="addon"></A>Add-on Process Sets</H2>
<P>The Process Dashboard was written to allow various processes to be 
followed, not just the PSP processes.  As such, we can offer add-on process 
sets that can be installed into the dashboard.  Check the downloads section 
of our website at <u class="url">http://www.processdash.com/download</u> for
the latest add-on process sets.</p>

<P>To install an add-on process set:</P>
<UL>
 <li>Choose &quot;Help <img src="../../Images/rarrow.png"> About&quot; from
   the "C" menu, and click the "Configuration" tab.  Just above the list of
   add-ons, a paragraph will tell you where the Process Dashboard is
   installed. Find that directory on your computer.  It should contain a
   small number of files, including one called "pspdash.jar".</li>
 <LI>Download the add-on process set from our website. When your browser asks 
   you whether you want to save the file or open it; choose 
   <B><I>Save</I></B>.&nbsp; Save the file into the directory you found in 
   the previous step. (In other words, the <I>pspdash.jar</I> file and the 
   add-on process file should be side-by-side in the same directory.  
   <STRONG><I>Do not</I></STRONG> overwrite the <I>pspdash.jar</I> file, just 
   save the process file into the same directory.)</li>
 <LI>If the dashboard is running, you will need to restart it for the new 
   processes to be found. </LI>
