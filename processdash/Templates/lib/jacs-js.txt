   Contact:   Sorry, I can't offer support for this but if you find a problem
              (or just want to tell me how useful you find it), please send
              me an email at jacsFeedback@tarrget.info (Note the two Rs in

   Credits:   I wrote this based on my Simple Calendar Widget script which
              I wrote from scratch myself but I couldn't have done either
              without the superb "JavaScript The Definitive Guide" by David
              Flanagan (Pub. O'Reilly ISBN 0-596-00048-0) and Peter-Paul Koch's
              (PPK) brilliant Quirksmode site.

   How to add the Calendar to your page:
              This script needs to be defined for your page so add the following
              line;
                    <script type='text/JavaScript' src='jacs.js'></script>

   How to use the Calendar once it is defined for your page:

        Dynamic calendar:

              Simply choose an event to trigger the calendar (like an onclick or an onmouseover)
              and an element to work on (for the calendar to take its initial date from and write
              its output date to) then write it like this;

                    onclick="JACS.show(document.getElementById('myElement'),event);"
                or
                    onfocus="JACS.show(this,event);"

              NOTE: If you wish to use the calendar with an Anchor tag, do not use the
                    href="javascript:JACS.show(...)" syntax.

                    Instead you should use the following;

                    <a href="#" onclick="JACS.show(<<element>>,event);return false;">
                        <<your text>>
                    </a>

              If you are using a text node then specify the text's parent node in the
              function call. The date should be the only text under that node;

                    <p onclick="JACS.show(this,event);"><<date>></p>

        Static calendar:

                    JACS.show(<<element>><<,optional calendar ID>><<,optional disabled days>>);

              A static calendar appears on screen when the page loads, cannot be dragged and
              remains on screen after it has been used to select a date. It returns the date
              into the value of a defined element (e.g. an INPUT element) but, of course,
              that can be hidden.

        Calendar with selected days:

              You can select days of the week by adding arguments to the
              call to JACS.show. These selected days can be the only ones
              enabled or the only ones disabled depending on the setting of
              the attribute valuesEnabled (see below). The values should be
              Sunday = 0 through to Saturday = 6. The parameters can be a
              series of single values or an array holding those values. A call
              to JACS.show with Friday and Monday selected could look something
              like this;

                        JACS.show(<<element>>,event,5,1);
              or this;
                        var myArray = [5,1];
                        JACS.show(<<element>>,event,myArray);

        Named calendar:

                    JACS.show(<<element>>,event<<,calendar ID>>);

              'jacs' is the default ID of the calendar but you can assign any ID
              you want.  You can call one name as many times as you like,
              but as it is one object, it can only appear on screen in one location
              at a time.  If you want more than that then you must give different IDs.

              [Note: in the above paragraph I use "name" and "id" interchangeably, not
                     in the sense of HTML tag attributes "name" and "id". ]

        No event? No problem!

              Normally the calendar will be triggered by an event but if you wish to
              control it in code and the event is not available to you, simply pass
              an element as the second parameter;

              E.G.  JACS.show(<<target element>>,<<source element>>);
                    as in: JACS.show(this,this);

        Calendar with post-processing:

              The following technique runs a function each time a dynamic calendar
              closes or a date is selected from a static calendar:

                    JACS.show(<<Dynamic or Static calendar argument list>>);
                    JACS.next(<<optional calendar ID,>><<function>><<,arguments>>);

              Where <<function>> is a function defined on the calling page
              and <<arguments>> is the list of arguments being passed to that
              function.

              The calendar ID defaults to 'jacs', if you are using a different
              calendar object (See calendar naming above), you must give its
              ID as the first argument.

              NOTES: These two calls are expected in this order (i.e. show before
                     next) because JACS.next expects the calendar object to exist.

                     If JACS.make has not been called for the object and JACS.show
                     is called after JACS.next then the calendar object may not
                     exist (if the object has not been created earlier in the
                     users path through the page) so a JavaScript error would
                     be generated.

              Every function that is triggered using JACS.next() acquires an
              attribute JACSid. This attribute holds the value of the
              calendar ID that JACS.next() has been called for. So, your
              function has access to all of the calendar instance's attributes.
              These include;
                dateReturned  Boolean TRUE if the calendar has been closed by
                              selection of a date, otherwise FALSE), and
                outputDate    The user-selected date in JavaScript date format.

                    E.G. document.getElementById(<<function>>.JACSid).dateReturned

        Disabling or enabling dates or date ranges;

              Setting enabled or disabled date ranges for a calendar object is
              achieved by setting the dates array attribute of the calendar object
              (see more information below).

              By default the calendar object is only created when it is first
              needed for display so you should make sure that it is explicitly
              created using;

                    JACS.make(<<calendar id>><<,dynamic (boolean, default TRUE)>>);

        Combining the techniques:

              A fully defined call to JACS.show, including all optional parameters
              should send parameters in the following order;

                            I/O      Trigger  Calendar  Selected
                            Element  Event    ID        days
              Dynamic         0        1        2         2/3
              Static          0                 1         1/2
              Type          Object   Object   String    Number(s)
              Required      Yes      Yes      No        No
              Default       None     None     'jacs'    None

              NOTE: The Trigger Event is ONLY relevant for dynamic calendars
                    and must be omitted for static calendars.

              Dynamic e.g.  JACS.show(document.getElementById('myElement1'),
                                      event,'jacs',0,1,2,3,4,5,6);

              Static  e.g.  JACS.show(document.getElementById('myElement2'),
                                           'myCal',0,6);

              A single calendar instance must not be called with both Dynamic
              and Static parameters (It is only one structure within the page
              so it cannot remain visible in one location while it is displayed
              in another).

   Version   Date        By               Description
   =======   ====        ===============  ===========
     1.30    2008-05-05  Anthony Garrett  Added optional auto-positioning of the
                                           calendar when its normal position would
                                           go off the visible area.
                                           Thanks to Chandramouli Iyer for this
                                           suggestion.
                                          Added an optional "Clear" button for
                                           use when handling a read-only text
                                           input element. Thanks to Sanjay Gangwal
                                           for his suggestion.

     1.21    2008-04-11  Anthony Garrett  Corrected the input month name parsing
                                            so that it set the calendar to the
                                            right month when long month names used.
                                            Thanks to Ben Diamand for this bug report.

     1.20    2008-04-10  Anthony Garrett  Added attribute to allow calendar to
                                           appear in "display" mode only (i.e.
                                           dates not selectable.

                                          Added the option to highlight specified
                                           dates and date ranges.

                                          Thanks to Ben Diamand for both
                                           suggestions.

     1.11    2008-02-24  Anthony Garrett  Trapped calls to script with only a
                                           NAME attribute is set for the target
                                           element when the script really requires
                                           an ID attribute.  This is the most
                                           frequent mistake reported to me.

     1.10    2008-01-14  Anthony Garrett  Restored the ability to use an element
                                           as the second parameter when opening a
                                           dynamic calendar while retaining the
                                           option of passing an event. Thanks to
                                           Thierry Blind and Sergey Snovsky for
                                           the feedback.

                                          Added a calendar attribute that holds the
                                           returned date. This simplifies use of
                                           the calendar within JavaScript. Thanks
                                           to Juha Valvanne for the query that
                                           led to this enhancement.

                                          Fixed bug in the handling of focus events
                                           that caused calendar to fail to appear.
                                           Thanks to Steve Davis for reporting the
                                           problem.

     1.00    2007-09-21  Anthony Garrett  Fixed JACS.next parameters - thanks to
                                           Rogier Lankhorst for the feedback, also
                                           refined JACS.next processing.

                                          Updated the event trapping to make it
                                           less intrusive on the page body.  NOTE:
                                           This requires that a dynamic calendar's
                                           second parameter should be the calling
                                           event (not the calling object as in
                                           previous versions).  Thanks to Steve
                                           Davis for the bug report that led to
                                           this change.

                                          Replaced the date input sequence user
                                           configuration setting with parsing the
                                           sequence from the full format. New users
                                           are often confused by the sequence and
                                           in practice (to allow the calendar's date
                                           output to be used for input) the sequence
                                           must always match the full format element
                                           order.

                                          Fixed a bug that caused undelimited
                                           dates to be handled incorrectly. They
                                           are now parsed against the full date
                                           output format then checked for validity.
                                           Thanks to Dan Wood for raising this bug.

                                          Fixed Standards-based (non IE)
                                           calendar dragging which wasn't releasing
                                           the calendar onmouseup.

                                          Fixed problem where selected weekdays
                                           carried over from one call to another
                                           on the same calendar object.

                                          Corrected the Month and Year select box
                                           displays in Opera. They were not changing

                                           calendar's left and right arrows.

                                          Extended IFRAME backing to all calendar objects
                                           in order to improve calendar display over
                                           some embedded applets and objects.  Thanks to
                                           Stanko Kupcevic for his feedback on this.
                                           NOTE: It is not possible to protect any
                                           JavaScript object displayed over an
                                           embedded DYNAMIC (and, therefore refreshed)
                                           object because browsers usually do not
                                           directly control the screen handling within
                                           the object.  The best advice therefore remains
                                           to design pages in such a way that the calendar
                                           does not overlap embedded objects.

                                         Added curly braces and semi-colons
                                           for best practice and for robustness
                                           when code is compacted/obfuscated.

     0.90    2007-04-04  Anthony Garrett  Major re-write of the script to allow
                                           multiple calendar objects visible on
                                           on the page, and to allow static
                                           calendars. Dropped the legacy
                                           "showCal" entry-point function.

                                          Added ability to select calendar
                                           position relative to return value
                                           element.  Thanks to Justin Lawrence
                                           for that request.

    EXPOSED CALENDAR OBJECTS (FUNCTIONS):

        JACS.make   Creates calendar objects;
                        is called as part of JACS.show (if needed) but can also
                        be called to create a calendar instance at any time.

        JACS.show   Entry point for display of a calendar: Called in main page.

        JACS.next   Sets up a function that runs when a date is selected on a
                    static calendar or a dynamic calendar moves or closes.

        JACS.cals   returns an array of all the calendar IDs that have been
                    used on the page.

                    NOTES: 1 "used" here means: Invoked with JACS.make or JACS.show.
                             Calls without a defined calendar ID invoke the default
                             ID, 'jacs'.

                           2 Each calendar structure is added to the page when it
                             is first used. So this array may not hold all dynamic
                             calendar IDs that are defined on the page.  If you
                             want to be sure that the array does show all of them,
                             explicitly invoke  JACS.make(<<ID>>); for each ID on
                             page load.
