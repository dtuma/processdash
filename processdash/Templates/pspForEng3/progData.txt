== Now that plain To Date values have been summed, manually perform the
== necessary calculations for the derived "To Date" metrics that appear
== on the Plan Summary Forms for the PSP assignments.  Note that we
== CANNOT just let these calculations be inherited, because in the
== traditional metrics datafile these would all be defined as lookup
== expressions extracting a number from a single shared To Date
== collection.  In contrast, we need a distinct "To Date" dataset
== for each assignment, which isn't how the dashboard regularly works.
== So we must define these manually.
==
== In addition, we will also define various aliases that appear on
== legacy plan summary forms.
