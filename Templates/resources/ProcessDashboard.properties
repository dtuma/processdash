Errors.Version_Incompatibility.Header=\
    This Process Dashboard dataset makes use of functionality\n\

Errors.Version_Incompatibility.Upgrade_Message=\
    Unfortunately, you are running an older version of the\n\
    software.  You must upgrade before you can open this\n\
    dataset.
Errors.Version_Incompatibility.Missing_Message=\
    Unfortunately, you have not installed these package(s). You\n\
    must install them before you can open this dataset.


Errors.Corrupt_Statefile_Title=Cannot read hierarchy file
Errors.Corrupt_Statefile_Warning_FMT=\
    The dashboard was unable to open and read the file that\n\
    contains your hierarchy.  This problem could be caused by\n\
    insufficient file permissions, or by corrupt data in the\n\
    file itself.  This is a very serious problem; the dashboard\n\
    will not continue until the problem is corrected.  Please\n\
    examine the file:\n        \
        {1}\n\
    and correct the following error{2,choice,0#|1# on line {2}}:\n        \
        {0}\n\
    If you cannot correct this error, the only other course of\n\
    action is to rename or delete the file.  This effectively\n\
    will cause all your data to be lost.

Errors.Broken_Data_Title=Missing Data Files
Errors.Broken_Data_Header=\
	Missing files are preventing the dashboard from opening the\n\
	data for the following projects/tasks\:
Errors.Broken_Data_Footer=\
	The most likely cause of this problem is that you created\n\
	the above projects/tasks based on an add-on process set,\n\
	then deleted the file containing that add-on process set.\n\
	If you use add-on process sets located in a network directory,\n\
	this problem could also occur when the network is unavailable.\n\
	The recommended course of action is to shut down the\n\
	dashboard, reinstall the add-on process set, then restart the\n\
	dashboard.  Until you do this, the data for these\n\
	projects/tasks will be inaccessible and/or incomplete.

Errors.Missing_MCF.Title=Missing Metrics Collection Framework Module
Errors.Missing_MCF.Header_FMT=\
    The Process Dashboard is packaged and distributed in a modular way. The \
    main application provides a core foundation for planning, tracking, and \
    analysis. Then process-specific scripts, forms, and reports are bundled \
    into separate modules, which you can optionally choose to install.\n\
    \ \n\
    You have requested to open a dataset that includes projects based upon the \
    optional {0} module. Unfortunately, you have not installed that {0} module \
    onto this computer.\n\
    \ \n\
    As a result, the dashboard cannot display the scripts, forms, reports, or \
    data for the following project(s):
Errors.Missing_MCF.TSP_Footer=\
    To resolve this problem, please visit the [[[Process Dashboard download \
    page]]] and download the installer that contains "PSP and TSP Process \
    Extensions." After you run that installer, try opening this dataset again.
Errors.Missing_MCF.Custom_Footer_FMT=\
    To resolve this problem, please contact your team leader or coach and ask \
    for a copy of the "{0} metrics collection framework" module. (They can \
    follow [[[these instructions]]] to locate that file.)  Save that file into \
    the directory {1}, then try opening this dataset again.
Errors.Missing_MCF.Custom_Footer_Zip_FMT=\
    To resolve this problem, please contact the person who gave you this Data \
    Backup file, and ask for a copy of the "{0} metrics collection framework" \
    module. (They can follow [[[these instructions]]] to locate that file.) \
    Save that file into the directory {1}, then try opening this dataset again.

Errors.Read_File_Error.Title=Cannot Open Data Files
Errors.Read_File_Error.Message_FMT=\
    The dashboard was unable to open and read {0}:\n        \
        {1}\n\
    \ \n\
    This problem could be caused by insufficient file permissions,\n\
    intermittent network problems, or other filesystem errors. To\n\
    prevent data loss/corruption, the dashboard must exit.

    The data for this dashboard is located in a directory under a\n\
    Shared Folder with the key "{0}."\n\
    \ \n\
    Unfortunately, your computer does not have a Shared Folder with\n\
    that key. To open this data, you may need to take one or both of\n\
    the following steps:\n\
    \ \n\
    \   \u2022 Install a desktop sync client (if the shared folder is in cloud\n\
    \     storage like OneDrive, Google Drive, DropBox, etc.)\n\
    \ \n\
    \   \u2022 Choose "Tools > Preferences > Shared Folders" in another\n\
    \     team or personal dashboard, and add an entry with the key\n\
    \     "{0}"
Errors.Shared_Folder.Dir_Error.Message_FMT=\
    The dashboard attempted to read data from the following directory:\n\
    \      {0}\n\
    \ \n\
    Unfortunately, that directory could not be found.\n\
    \ \n\
    If the directory is on a network file server, check your network\n\
    connection and try again.\n\
    \ \n\
    If the directory is in cloud storage (such as OneDrive, Google Drive,\n\
    DropBox, etc), make sure:\n\
    \    \u2022 Its owner has shared the directory with you\n\
    \    \u2022 You have added the directory to your personal cloud storage\n\
    \       area (via a shortcut, link, alias, etc.)\n\
    \    \u2022 You have installed the desktop client for that cloud service,\n\
    \       it is currently running, and it has synchronized that directory\n\
    \       to this computer.

Errors.Save_Error.Message_FMT=\
	The dashboard was unable to save the following data:\n        \
        {0} \n\
	This problem could be caused by insufficient file permissions,\n\
	intermittent network problems, or other filesystem errors.  If\n\

	this data?
Errors.Save_Error.Remote_Message=\
