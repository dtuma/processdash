Migrate.Confirm.Title=Migrate Data?
Migrate.Confirm.Message=\
    An experimental 'bundled' file format is available for the\n\
    dashboard. This format improves performance over slow\n\
    networks, but requires all team members to upgrade to\n\
    Process Dashboard version 2.6.6.\n\
    \ \n\
    Would you like to migrate this dataset (and the projects\n\
    it manages) to bundled file format?

Migrate.Projects.Complete=Projects migrated.                     \u00a0
Migrate.Restart.Title=OK to Shut Down?
Migrate.Restart.Message=\
    The dashboard needs to shut down to migrate core data to\n\
    bundled file format. Press OK to continue.\n\
    \ \n\
    After the migration and shut down are complete, you can\n\
    reopen the dashboard as desired.
