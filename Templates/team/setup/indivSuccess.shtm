<p>This mode of operation is <b>not supported</b>.  When you do this, each
joined computer will end up having an independent database of actual project
data.  Each time you export data from one computer, you will overwrite the
data written by the other computer(s).</p>

<p>If you'd like to open your personal dashboard from more than one computer,
ask your organization to consider using the <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.processdash.com/pdes-indiv">Process Dashboard Enterprise
Server</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 3px">In the meantime, you will need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pick one computer where you'll enter data for this project, and</li>
<li>Use &quot;<img src="/help/Images/cmenu.png"> &rarr; Alter Project &rarr;
     Delete&quot; to delete this team project from the personal dashboard on
     the other computers.</li>
