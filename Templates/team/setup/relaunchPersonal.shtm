<p>A personal project lets you manage a complex plan with a large number of
tasks, and track your progress against that plan.  But from time to time, you
may wish to clean up your old/completed tasks, and get a fresh start on a new
plan looking forward.  You might do this during a personal replanning session,
or at the start of a new project iteration.</p>

<p>This Relaunch Wizard is designed to help you create a starting point for a
new plan.  The relaunch wizard will:</p>

<ul>

<li>Mark the "<tt><!--#echo var=PATH_TRANSLATED --></tt>" project as
<b><u>closed</u></b>, indicating that no additional work will be performed
there.</li>

<li>Create a new personal project to hold the plan for the new iteration.</li>

<li>Copy the workflows, milestones, and calendar of available hours from the
old plan to the new plan.</li>

<li>Copy incomplete components and tasks from the old plan to the new plan,
and adjust the planned times of in-progress tasks to account for work that
has already been performed.</li>

<li>Create a new schedule that calculates plan/forecast dates starting this
week and looking forward.</li>

</ul>

<p>If you are ready to close this cycle and create a new plan based on the
remaining work, press the Next button to continue.</p>
