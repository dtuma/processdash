<h2>Workflow Rates Detected</h2>

<form action='wizard.class' method='post'>
<input type='hidden' name='page' value='keepRates'>

<p>In the project you are relaunching, the following workflows use
size-driven task rates (entered in the "Rate" column):</p>

<ul>
<!--#foreach name="WORKFLOW" list=[setup//Relaunch_Rate_Workflows] -->
    <li><!--#echo value='WORKFLOW' --></li>
<!--#endfor-->
</ul>

<p>The use of workflow task rates is <b>no longer recommended</b>.
The current best practice is to create proxy estimation tables that
capture these rates, then clear the "Rate" column for all of your
workflow steps.</p>

<p>Newly relaunched projects are encouraged to migrate away from
workflow task rates, because they prevent you from using the latest
project features and enhancements.</p>

<p>Which would you like to do?</p>
