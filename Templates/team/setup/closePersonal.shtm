<p>When a project is finished or cancelled, you may hold a personal
retrospective to review project data and collect lessons learned. As
part of this effort, you may wish to mark the project as
<b><u>closed</u></b>.</p>

<p>Marking a project as "closed" has the following effects:</p>

<ul>

<li>It deletes tasks from your working plan that you haven't started
yet. The tasks will still be present in the WBS, but won't appear in
the main dashboard toolbar as work that needs to be performed.</li>

<li>It marks in-progress tasks as complete. Together with the previous
item, this means your project schedule will show as being 100%
complete.</li>

<li>You will still be able to enter missing data for the project (for
example, to record defects, capture actual size, or fill in forgotten
time log entries).  You will also be able to edit your existing data
to correct any mistakes you find.</li>

<li><b>However</b>, if you use the play/pause buttons to log time
against tasks in this project, you will see a warning that the tasks
in question have been marked complete. (This can help you to avoid
collecting new time log data accidentally.)</li>

<li>If you open the Work Breakdown Structure for this project, you will
see a warning that the project has been marked complete, and that no
additional work should be performed here.  (This can help you to avoid
creating new tasks in the project by accident.)  If you do create new
tasks in the WBS, those changes will have no effect. (The new tasks
will not be copied down into your personal plan for the closed
project.)</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Note:</b> if the work on this project is ongoing, but you simply
wish to close this project cycle and begin a new cycle, it is more
helpful to <a href="relaunchPersonal.shtm">relaunch</a> the project
instead.</p>

<p>Would you like to mark the "<tt><!--#echo var=PATH_TRANSLATED --></tt>"
project as <b><u>closed</u></b>?</p>
