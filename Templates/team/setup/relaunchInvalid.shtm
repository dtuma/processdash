<h2>Invalid Request</h2>

<p>This wizard automates the task of relaunching a
<!--#if datasetMode eq 'team' -->team<!--#else-->personal<!--#endif-->
project.</p>

<p>
<!--#if notTeamRoot -->
However, &quot;<!--#echo var=PATH_TRANSLATED -->&quot; is not the root of a
team project.

<!--#elif notPersonalRoot -->
However, &quot;<!--#echo var=PATH_TRANSLATED -->&quot; is not the root of a
personal project.

<!--#elif isRelaunched -->
However, the &quot;<!--#echo var=PATH_TRANSLATED -->&quot; project has
already been closed and relaunched at some time in the past.

<!--#elif badTeamTools -->
However, it requires version 4.1 or higher of the "Advanced Team Tools"
plugin, and you only have version <!--#echo Dash_Package_teamTools -->.
You will need to upgrade to a more recent version of the dashboard
before you can use the Relaunch Wizard.

<!--#elif quickLaunch -->
Unfortunately, you are currently running the dashboard against a Data
Backup (e.g. ZIP/PDBK) file. The relaunch wizard can only operate against live
data.

<!--#elif readOnly -->
Unfortunately, you are currently running the dashboard in read-only
mode.  Accordingly, you cannot relaunch this project until you restart
the dashboard in read-write mode.

<!--#endif-->

Therefore, this wizard cannot continue.</p>
