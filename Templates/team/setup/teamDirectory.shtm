<p>This Team Dashboard is using <a target="_blank"
href="/teamhelp/frame.html?TeamConfigDir.local"><b>shared network
directories</b></a> to facilitate coordination.  These directories are
used to hold team-level planning information, such as the project's work
breakdown structure.  <!--#if ![setup//Is_Master] -->They also hold
exported snapshots of individual data, for use in computing team
reports.<!--#endif--></p>

<!--#if [setup//Suggested_Team_Dir]  && not [setup//Team_Dir] -->

<p>The Project Setup Wizard can store project data in the same directory as
the Team Dashboard.  This is a best practice, since it greatly simplifies
ongoing configuration and maintenance.  To follow this recommendation,
<b>click &quot;Next&quot; to accept the default value</b> shown below.
If you have a compelling need to place <i>team project</i> data in a
separate location than <i>Team Dashboard</i> data, you can alter this
path.</p>

<!--#else-->

<p>The Project Setup Wizard needs the location of a directory that can hold
data for this project.  Please enter the selected path below.</p>

<!--#endif-->

<p>The directory you choose <b><u>must meet</u></b> all of the same
<a href="/teamhelp/frame.html?TeamConfigDir.local"
target="_blank">accessibility and permissions criteria</a> as the Team
Dashboard data directory:</p>

<ul>

<li>It must be <b>accessible, readable, and writable by all team
members</b>.  Because of this, it also needs to be a shared network
directory.</li>

<li>Permissions are set to "inherit" - so that when new files and
subdirectories are created, all team members can read/write them as
well.</li>

<!--#if ![setup//Is_Master] -->
<li>Since the directory will hold personal data collected by
individuals, it should be configured with permissions that forbid file
access by non-team members.</li>
<!--#endif-->

</ul>

<td>Shared network directories are a simple choice for team collaboration,
but they are not a perfect fit for every organization.  If you cannot
create a shared directory that all team members can access, other options
are available. <a href="/teamhelp/frame.html?TeamConfigDir"
target="_blank">Click here for more information.</a></td>

<p>Any number of projects can share the same team directory; the
process dashboard will still be able to track which data belongs to
which project.  (This is true even if the projects are using different
team processes.)  Thus, if you have a team which is performing several
projects (or project phases) one after another, it is not necessary to
create a new team directory for each project/phase.</p>

<p>If the members of your team are predominately using the Microsoft
Windows operating system, the use of a UNC path is strongly
recommended.  That is, you would enter the directory path as
<tt>\\serverName\path\to\directory</tt> instead of
<tt>T:\path\to\directory</tt>.</p>
