<h1>Synchronization Problem</h1>

<p>To synchronize your hierarchy with a team project, the dashboard must
know your initials.  The synchronization process matches your intials
against the task assignments in the Work Breakdown Structure to find tasks
that are assigned to you.</p>

<p>When you joined the project, you stated that your initials are
&quot;<tt><!--#echo [Indiv_Initials] --></tt>&quot;.  However, those
initials don't match any of the entries in the Team Member List for this
project.</p>

<p>Usually, this just means that you typed a particular set of initials for
yourself when you joined the team project, but your team has entered a
slightly different set of initials for you in the WBS team member list.  To
fix this problem, please choose your name from the following list, then
click Next.</p>
