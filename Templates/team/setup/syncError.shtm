<h1>Synchronization Problem</h1>

<!--#if generalError -->

The synchronization tool was unable to synchronize your project:
<!--#echo generalError -->

<!--#elif notTeamProject -->

This synchronization tool can only operate upon a team project.

<!--#elif hierEditorOpen -->

This synchronization tool cannot proceed because the Hierarchy Editor
is currently open.  Please close the Hierarchy Editor, then 
<a href="sync.class?<!--#echo _UNIQUE_ -->">click here</a> to try again.

<!--#elif serverUnavailable -->

To synchronize your hierarchy with the WBS, the dashboard must contact
the server located at
<pre><!--#echo serverUrl --></pre>

Unfortunately, the server could not be reached.  Please check your network
connection and try again.  If the problem persists, contact the server
administrator.

<!--#elif serverForbidden -->

To synchronize your hierarchy with the WBS, the dashboard must read a
description of the project work breakdown structure.  Unfortunately, you do
not have permission to read or write data files for this project.

<p>Contact your team leader for help.  Ask them to make sure that:</p>

<ul>

<li>You've been added to the Team Member List in the WBS Editor, and</li>

<li>Your username (<!--#echo serverForbidden -->) has been registered with
    your entry there.</li>

</ul>

<p>After these problems have been corrected, you can try the "Sync to WBS"
operation again.</p>

<!--#elif teamDirUnavailable -->

To synchronize your hierarchy with the WBS, the dashboard must read
project data files from the directory
<pre><!--#echo teamDir --></pre>

Unfortunately, that directory could not be found.  Please check your network
connection and try again.  If the problem persists, contact your team leader
for help.

<!--#elif sharedFolderUnknownKey -->

<p>To synchronize your hierarchy with the WBS, the dashboard must read
project data files from the team data directory.  The team dashboard
indicates the directory is located:</p>

<table style="margin-left: 1cm">
<tr><td><b>Under Shared Folder with Key:</b>&nbsp;</td>
    <td><tt><!--#echo key --></tt></td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:right"><b>In Subdirectory:</b>&nbsp;</td>
    <td><tt><!--#echo relPath --></tt></td></tr>
</table>

<p>Unfortunately, you do not have a Shared Folder entry with that key.
Please contact your team leader for help.  You may need to take one or
both of the following steps:</p>

<ul>

<li>Install a desktop sync client, if the shared folder is in cloud
storage (such as OneDrive, Google Drive, DropBox, etc)</li>

<li style="margin-top: 1em">Open "<!--#if !isTeam && !isMaster
--><img src="/help/Images/cmenu.png"> &rarr; <!--#endif-->Tools &rarr;
Preferences &rarr; Shared Folders" and add an entry with the key
"<tt><!--#echo key --></tt>", indicating where the shared folder can
be found.</li>

</ul>

<!--#elif sharedFolderDirNotFound -->

<p>To synchronize your hierarchy with the WBS, the dashboard must read
project data files from the directory</p>

<pre><!--#echo teamDir --></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, that directory could not be found.</p>

<ul>

<li style="margin-top: 1em">If the directory is on a <b>network file
server</b>, check your network connection and try again.  If the
problem persists, contact your team leader for help.</li>

<li style="margin-top: 1em">If the directory is in <b>cloud storage</b>
(such as OneDrive, Google Drive, DropBox, etc), make sure:</li>

    <ul>
    <li style="margin-top: 0.5em">Its owner has shared the
        directory with you</li>
    <li>You have added the directory to your personal cloud
        storage area (via a shortcut, link, alias, etc.)</li>
    <li>You have installed the desktop client for that cloud
        service, it is currently running, and it has synchronized
        that directory to this computer.</li>
    </ul>

</ul>

<!--#elif teamDirMissing -->

To synchronize your hierarchy with the WBS, the dashboard must
know the directory of the team project.  Before you can synchronize
your hierarchy, you must first enter this value on the

<!--#elif wbsFileInaccessible -->

To synchronize your hierarchy with the WBS, the dashboard must
read a description of the project work breakdown structure.  The dashboard
attempted to read this description from the file 
<pre><!--#echo wbsFile --></pre>

but the file could not be read.  Ensure that you have permission to read the
file, then try again.

<!--#elif emptyTeam -->

To synchronize your hierarchy with a team project, the dashboard searches
through the team Work Breakdown Structure, looking for tasks that have been
assigned to you.  However, at this time no team members have been entered
in the Work Breakdown Structure yet.  This usually means that you need to
<b>wait</b> until your team has created the detailed plan for this project.
Check with your team leader to ensure that team planning is complete, then
try again.

<!--#elif unlistedMember -->

To synchronize your hierarchy with a team project, the dashboard matches
your intials against the task assignments in the Work Breakdown Structure
to find tasks that are assigned to you.  Unfortunately, your initials do
not appear in the Team Member List for this project.  Please contact your
team leader or planning manager, and ask them to make certain you have been
added to this project's Team Member List.  Then try the synchronization
operation again.

<!--#elif initialsMissing -->

To synchronize your hierarchy with a team project, the dashboard must
know your initials.  Before you can synchronize your hierarchy, you
must first enter your initials on the

<!--#elif mergeConfirm -->

<script type="text/javascript">
    window.location.replace("syncBundleMergeStart.shtm");
</script>

You have edited the work breakdown structure while your computer
was offline, so these changes need to be
<a href="syncBundleMergeStart.shtm">merged</a>.

<!--#elif mergeConflict -->

The dashboard was able to merge some of your local changes into the
team work breakdown structure.  Unfortunately, some of your changes
were in conflict with edits made by other people.  The WBS Editor will
now open to display those conflicts.

<p>Please switch to the WBS Editor window to review and address each
editing conflict, and save changes as needed.  Once all the conflicts
have been resolved, you can
<a href="sync.class?<!--#echo _UNIQUE_ -->">click here</a> to try the
synchronization operation again.</p>

<!--#elif mergeError -->

The dashboard attempted to merge your local offline changes into the
team work breakdown structure.  Unfortunately, this operation was
unsuccessful.

<p>This failure is likely caused by poor network connectivity, or by
your file sync client being offline.  You can
<a href="sync.class?<!--#echo _UNIQUE_ -->">click here</a> to try
again, and choose the "Defer for now" option until your network
problems are resolved.</p>
