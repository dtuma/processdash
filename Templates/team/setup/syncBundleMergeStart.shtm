<h1>Synchronizing Work Breakdown Structure</h1>

<h2>Merge Offline Changes?</h2>

<p>You have edited the work breakdown structure while your computer
was offline, so your view of the team project has diverged from the
view shared by the rest of the team.  To resolve this discrepancy, you
should merge your changes into the team work breakdown structure.</p>

<p>For this merge operation to succeed, you must:<ul>

    <li>be online with a valid network connection, and</li>

    <li>ensure your file sync client (e.g. OneDrive, DropBox, Google
        Drive, etc.) is running, logged in, and actively synchronizing
        files.</li>

    </ul></p>

<p>If you are not currently online, you can temporarily continue using
your locally modified offline version of the work breakdown structure.
Please find a time in the near future to connect, start your sync
client, and perform a "Sync to WBS" operation again.</p>
