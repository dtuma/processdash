<p>For help and instructions on the use of the Process Dashboard, you can
open the <a href="http://help/QuickOverview">User's&nbsp;Manual</a> at any
time by clicking the "<img src='Images/cmenu.png'>" menu on the main window,
then choosing "Help&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Help&nbsp;Topics."</p>

<p>If this is your first time to run the dashboard, you might benefit from the
<a href="http://help/QuickStart">quick start guide</a>, which provides a
quick walkthrough of dashboard usage.</p>

<p>If you will be participating as a member of a Team Project, contact your
team leader. They will send you a link you can use to join the team project
and create your personal plan.</p>

<p>If you plan to work by yourself (not as a member of a team project), you
can create a personal project by clicking the "<img src='Images/cmenu.png'>"
menu on the main window, then choosing "New&nbsp;Project."</p>
