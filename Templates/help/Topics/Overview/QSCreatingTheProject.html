<P>The first thing we need to do to get started is to create a new PSP2.1
project in the dashboard.  To do that, we will start the <a
href="../Planning/UsingHierarchyEditor.html">hierarchy editor</a> by
choosing Hierarchy from the
<a href="../Execution/ConfigureMenu.html">Configure menu</a>.</P>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/QSHierarchyEditorBefore.png"></p>

<P>We need to decide where to place this project in our work breakdown
structure.  For this example, we will imagine that we are responsible
for supporting a legacy application called "Product 1".  Our users have
identified a problem, and issued "Software Change Request (SCR)&nbsp;#42".</p>

<p>As you can see in the image above, this user has created "nodes" or
"folders" in their hierarchy to keep things nicely organized.  We will
place this change request under the
&quot;Project&nbsp;/&nbsp;Legacy&nbsp;/&nbsp;Product&nbsp;1&quot; node in our work hierarchy.  To do that we will select the "Product
1" node by clicking it once. Next we will pick the "Edit" menu and choose
"Add Template" followed by "PSP2.1". This will add a PSP2.1-based project
to the project hierarchy as a child of "Product 1".  When the new project
is added, it is given a default name.  We can change the name to better
describe what we are working on.  In this case, we will choose a helpful
name, like "SCR 42".  For more information on using the hierarchy editor,
and creating both "nodes" and projects, see the <a
href="../Planning/UsingHierarchyEditor.html">Using the hierarchy editor</a>
help topic.</P>

<P>Once the project has been created and renamed, click on the little
expansion control to the left of the "SCR 42" project to expand its child
nodes in the hierarchy tree.  There you can see that the dashboard has
placed all the process phases for a PSP2.1 project.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/QSHierarchyEditorAfter.png"></p>

<P>Now we can save our changes and close the hierarchy editor via the File 
menu.<p>
