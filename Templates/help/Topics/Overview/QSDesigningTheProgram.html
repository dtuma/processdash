<P>The PSP provides Development scripts for all the levels.  To access the
development script for this program, we can click the web browser's back
button to go back to the Planning script, then click the appropriate hyperlink
near the bottom of the page.  Or we can click the 
<a href="../Execution/AccessingScripts.html">script button</a> on the Process
Dashboard toolbar to view the full list of scripts and forms provided by the
current project, and choose "PSP2.1 Development Script" from the menu.</p>

<p>While designing this program, we will be sure to keep the dashboard's timer
running.  This can be confirmed by noticing the state of the play/pause
button.  For more information on the play/pause button, see the <a
href="../Execution/PlayPause.html">play/pause button</a> help topic.</P>

<P>Once finished with the program design, we click the completion checkbox to
mark the design phase complete.</p>

<p>The dashboard will move us to the next phase, which is design
review.  We perform a thorough review of our design, and find several
defects.  To enter each defect, we click the defect button.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/QSDesignReviewDefectButton.png"></p>

<p>The defect dialog appears, allowing us to enter all the pertinent
data about the defect.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/QSDesignReviewDefect.png"></p>

<p>After you enter the data for a defect, click the OK button to save it.
Then, if you need to enter another defect, click the defect button on the
main dashboard window again. For more information about entering defects into
the dashboard, see the 
<a href="../Execution/EnteringDefects.html">Entering Defects</a> help
topic.</p>

<p>Of course, several more defects were found during the review, but
we won't show them all.</p>

<P>Once the design review is finished, we click the completion checkbox
and move along to coding.</p>
