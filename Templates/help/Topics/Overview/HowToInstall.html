<H1>How To Install</H1>

<H2>System Requirements</H2>

<P>The Process Dashboard is 100% Java, and will run on any system with a Java 
2 compliant virtual machine. This includes Windows, Linux, Unix,
and Macintosh systems. For access to forms and scripts, a supported web
browser is also required.</p>

<P>To use the process dashboard, you must <b>first</b> install the following 
software:</P> 

<UL>
 <LI><a name="jre"></a>The Java Runtime Environment, version 1.6 or
   greater (available from Oracle at <a target="_blank"
   href="http://www.java.com/">http://www.java.com/</a>)</li>

 <LI>Make certain that JavaScript is enabled in your web browser.
   (This is typically the default setting, so you usually don't need
   to worry about enabling these unless you explicitly disabled them
   in the past.)</li>

 <LI>If you connect to the internet via a proxy server, you may need to tell 
   your browser to bypass the proxy for the address "localhost". The 
   instructions below may not apply to your browser word-for-word, but should 
   hopefully get you pointed in the right direction:
  <UL>
   <LI>For Internet Explorer, choose &quot;Tools <IMG BORDER="0"
    SRC="../../Images/rarrow.png" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="9"> Internet 
      Options&quot;. Click on the "Connections" tab, then on the "LAN
      Settings" button. Make certain the "Bypass proxy server for
      local addresses" box is <B><STRONG>checked</STRONG></B>.</li>

   <LI>For Firefox, no changes are typically necessary.  If you have trouble
    viewing dashboard scripts and forms, open the Options dialog.  On the
    Advanced pane, choose the Network tab and click the button to configure
    settings for how Firefox connects to the Internet.  On that Connection
    Settings dialog, ensure that the "No Proxy for" box contains
    "localhost".</LI>

<H2>Installation Instructions</H2>

<ol>

  <li>Before attempting to install the dashboard, make certain you
    have installed the required software listed above.  In particular,
    the Process Dashboard installer program will not run if you do not
    have the <a href="#jre">Java Runtime Environment</a> installed on
    your computer.</li>

  <li><a name="installer"></a>Download the Process Dashboard installer
    program from <a href="http://www.processdash.com/download"
    target="_blank">http://www.processdash.com/download</a>
    and follow the directions found there.</li>

 <li>Please consider subscribing to our announcements mailing list. We will 
   send email to this mailing list when new versions of the tool are 
   available.  You can subscribe to the list at <a target="_blank"
   href="http://www.processdash.com/mailingList">http://www.processdash.com/mailingList</a></li>

</ol>

<H2>Upgrade Instructions</H2>

<p>The Process Dashboard installer can also be used to upgrade an existing
installation.  If the dashboard is already installed on your computer, you can
run the installer for a newer version to upgrade.  You <b>do not</b> need to
uninstall the older version of the dashboard first.</p>


<H2><A name="addon"></A>Optional Modules</H2>

<p>The Process Dashboard is extensible, and some features are packaged as
optional modules.  During installation, you can choose which modules you wish
to install.</p>

<p>For example, a module is available that provides scripts and forms from the
Personal Software Process.  If you write software, this module can help you to
improve your development process.</p>

<p>If you perform a minimal installation of the dashboard, then decide later
that you would like to use one of the optional modules, just run the dashboard
installer again.  When it asks you which modules you wish to install, just
check the boxes for the optional modules you desire.  Accept the default
configuration settings that the installer offers on the remaining pages, and
your existing installation will be updated with the optional modules you
selected. (It is <b>never</b> necessary to uninstall the dashboard before
running the installer again.)</p>
