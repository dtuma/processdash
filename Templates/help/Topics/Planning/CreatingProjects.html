<h1>Creating Projects</h1>

<p>The Process Dashboard provides powerful support for planning,
tracking, and managing a set of work.  To take advantage of these
features, the first step is to create a project.</p>

<p>Dashboard projects can support team work or individual work.  These
two project types are described below.</p>


<h2><a name="team"></a>Team Projects</h2>

<p>If you will be collaborating with other people on the work, you
should work with your team leader to create a team project.  A team
project allows your team to share a common work breakdown structure,
to support each other on shared tasks, and to see project-level
reports that roll up data from everyone on the team.</p>

<p>Team Projects are created within a Team Dashboard, which
coordinates the flow of shared data.  Then, you and your team members
join the project from your personal dashboard.</p>

<p>See the <a href="../../../teamhelp/Topics/Overview.html">Team
Use</a> section of the Users Manual for extensive help on the use of
team projects to plan, track, and manage team work.</p>


<h2><a name="personal"></a>Personal Projects</h2>

<p>For independent work (or for times when your team members are not
using the Process Dashboard), you can create a personal project.  A
personal project:</p>

<ul>

<li>Gives you tools to quickly and easily create a detailed personal
    task plan</li>

<li>Helps you predict when the work might finish, so you can manage
    your commitments to others</li>

<li>Provides charts and reports for tracking your progress and
    improving your process</li>

</ul>

<p>You can also use a personal project to capture data about a
collection of miscellaneous tasks, even if you don't need to track
your progress against a schedule. The
<a href="../../../teamhelp/Topics/EditingTheWBS.html">Work Breakdown
Structure Editor</a> makes it easy to enter the list of tasks.  Then
you can use the dashboard toolbar to log time, mark tasks complete,
etc.</p>

<p>To create a personal project, just choose "New Project" from the 
<a href="../Execution/ConfigureMenu.html">configuration menu</a>.</p>


<h2>Comparing Project Types</h2>

<p style="margin-bottom:16px">Team projects and personal projects are more
alike than they are different.  Essentially, a personal project provides all
of the same powerful planning and tracking tools that teams find useful,
streamlined for a project that has only one team member.  The table below
offers a comparison:</p>
