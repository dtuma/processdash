<P>Planning a software project is just as important as planning any other 
complicated endeavor.  In his book <I>A Discipline for Software 
Engineering</I> Watts Humphrey devotes three chapters to planning 
activities.  This help topic will not rehash the ideas put forth there, but 
will simply serve as a reminder that planning is essential!</P>

<P>The Process Dashboard provides extensive help for your planning activities.
You can <a href="CreatingProjects.html">create projects</a> and enter tasks
in a work breakdown structure, so that time, size, and defect data can be
tracked.  The <a  href="UsingProbeTool.html">PROBE tool</a> and <a 
href="UsingProbeWizard.html">PROBE Wizard</a> help automate the <b>PRO</b>xy 
<b>B</b>ased <b>E</b>stimation method.  Finally, the <a
href="UsingTaskSchedule.html">Task and Schedule Tool</a> allows you to
create a schedule and track your progress against it using earned value.</P>
