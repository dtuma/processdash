<h1><!--SEP--><a href="../Overview/HowToInstall.html#addon"><img border="0" class="sepnotice" src="../../Images/PSPDisclaimer.png"></a> <!--/SEP-->Using the Size Estimating Template</h1>

<p>The Size Estimating Template is used to help make estimates of how big a
new project will be or how long it will take to create the project (size and
time estimation).  It is patterned after the Size Estimating Template from
Watts Humphrey's book <i>A&nbsp;Self-Improvement Process for Software
Engineers</i>.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../../Images/SizeEstimatingTemplate.png"></p>

<p>(Note: Watts Humphrey released an earlier book called <i>A&nbsp;Discipline
for Software Engineering</i> which used a very different layout for this
form.  If you are using the old version of the PSP scripts, you will see the
old form layout.  The paragraphs below describe the new version of the
form.)</p>

<p>Right near the top of the form is a link to bring up the Size Estimating
Template instructions form.  The dashboard will bring up the instructions in
a separate web browser so that the two can be placed side by side on your
screen.</p>

<p>Also, there are several links on the form that will add rows to the form.  
If you need more room than the form provides, just click on the appropriate 
link and it will expand for you.</p>

<p>The header section contains a field for your name.  If the field is empty,
go ahead and enter your name; it will show up on the other forms as well.</p>

<p>The Size Estimating Template can be used to estimate many different types
of work.  If you are using a PSP task, the dashboard will assume that you are
producing software source code, and will automatically enter "LOC" in the
"Size Measure" field.  If you are using a defined team workflow, the size
measure from that process will be entered into this field instead.  If you are
using a <a href="../Planning/UsingHierarchyEditor.html#generic">generic project</a>,
you must enter the appropriate size metric in this field.</p>

<h2><a name="baseLOC"></a>Base Parts</h2>

<p>The Base Parts section is where you enter the information about any
preexisting components that may need modifications during the course of
your project.  If you have several of these components, you can use a
separate line for each.</p>

<p>The form has blanks for both Estimated and Actual sets of data.  During the
planning phase of the project, you should enter data in the Estimated columns.
After the project is finished and you are in the postmortem phase, you can
enter data in the Actual columns.</p>

<p>The form asks for the base size and the size of deleted, added, and
modified elements.  In the BASE column, enter the size of the preexisting
component. (For example if you are creating a modification to an already
existing computer program, the LOC from the existing program count as base
LOC.)</p>

<p>In the next three columns, you estimate the size of deleted, modified, and
added elements.  (Continuing the software example, you would enter the number
of existing LOC you think you might delete, the number of existing LOC you
think you might modify, and some number of new LOC you think you might add.)
A histogram appears to show you how these numbers relate to the size of the
preexisting, base component.  You can drag sliders to estimate an approximate
percentage.</p>

<h2><a name="baseAdditions"></a>Parts Additions</h2>

<p>Parts Additions is the section where you will record the bulk of new
development in most of your projects.  This section allows you to estimate the
new components you believe you will create during the course of this project.
You can choose the level of granularity that makes the most sense for your
estimating needs.  For software development, these could be new objects, new
files, new functions, new subroutines, new methods, etc.  For document
creation, these could be new documents, new document sections, new paragraphs,
etc.  Each object should be something you can visualize during the planning
process, and whose size can be estimated using the Size Metric displayed in
the field at the top of the form.</p>

<p>Blanks are provided to enter the description of each added part, the type
of part that is being added, the number of items that are going to be added of
this type, the relative size of these items, and the numeric estimate/measure
of the size of each added part.</p>

<p>The type of each part is selected from a table of standard object
categories.  When you first begin using this form, you may not have such a
table.  If you or your team members create one or more tables, you can enter
them by clicking on the hyperlink at the top of the column.  (If you are
estimating software development in LOC, you will have the benefit of a default
set of categories: namely Calculation, Data, I/O, Logic, Setup or Text.  New
PSP users should usually stick to the preset types; as you gain experience,
you may use your PSP training to define your own proxy categories.)  Select
the category that best fits the type of each added part.</p>

<p>The number of items can be useful when you are estimating a high-level
object.  For example, if you are estimating the size of an object or class in
an object-oriented language, you could use this field to record the number of
methods that will be present in an object you plan to create.  If you are
using some custom proxy type category, this field could capture the count of
proxy elements you plan to produce.  If these scenarios don't apply, you can
leave this field blank or enter the number "1".</p>

<p>The relative size pull down allows you to choose from subjective size
categories such as Very Small, Small, Medium, Large, and Very Large.  To
produce the most accurate estimates, you should aim for a level of planning
granularity that allows most of your planned parts to be of Medium size, with
a balance of smaller and larger parts.</p>

<p>After you enter values in the previous three columns, the data from the
proxy category table will be used to produce an estimated size.  If the
generated number seems too big or too small, choose a different relative size.
If you did not have a table of object categories to use, you should make your
best estimate of the size and enter it into this field.</p>

<p>If you are writing software, consider whether each new part is sufficiently
general purpose that it can be checked into a reuse library.  Generally this
means more than just code that can probably be reused in the general sense.
It usually has to do with proper packaging of the code as well: Are proper
interfaces defined?  Is the code sufficiently well documented?  Etc.  If you
intend to design the code for reuse, put a check mark in the NR (New Reusable)
column.</p>

<h2><a name="reusedObjects"></a>Reused Parts</h2>

<p>Reused parts are typically only used during software development; they are
objects that are brought into the program from a reuse library and used
verbatim.  New PSP users can sometimes be confused by the difference between a
reused part and a base part.  The main rule is that you must not count the
same component as both base and reused - otherwise the size accounting
formulas will not work out correctly.  In addition, the form will not let you
enter added/deleted/modified size for reused parts, so you should only put
items in the reused parts section if they can be reused with no changes.</p>

<h2><a name="time"></a>Performing the size/time estimation</h2>

<p>Once you have thought through all the changes that are going to be made to
the software, you are ready to calculate a prediction of size and or time.
The form will add up numbers from the sections above to produce an Estimated
Proxy Size, which the PROBE method will use as your base estimate.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../../Images/ProbeWizardLink.png"></p>

<p>The Size Estimation Template offers a link that will allow you to choose 
the PROBE Wizard to help you make your estimates.  If you use the PROBE 
Wizard, it will read your Estimated Proxy Size off the size estimating 
template automatically, and will save your chosen estimates back to the size 
estimating template automatically. For more information about using the PROBE 
Wizard, see the <a href="UsingProbeWizard.html">Using the PROBE Wizard</a> 
help topic.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you use the PROBE tool, you will need to type the 
Estimated Proxy Size into the Estimate field on the tool. Once you have 
investigated the relationships among your process data, you should manually 
copy your final estimates back to the size estimating template, along with 
the various other measures that come about as a result of the estimation 
(<i>B</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>B</i><sub>1</sub>, UPI, LPI, prediction range, 
r<sup>2</sup>, probe method selected). If you use PROBE method C or D, the 
Prediction Range field and the other numeric fields below it can be left 
blank. For more information about the PROBE tool provided by the dashboard, 
see the <a href="UsingProbeTool.html">Using the PROBE tool</a> help topic.</p>

<h2><a name="postmortem"></a>Entering Actual data during Postmortem</h2>

<p>Once you reach the Postmortem phase and you have the Actual size data, 
you should return to this form to enter the actuals for the various measures 
on the form (base, deleted, modified, and added size, counts for the 
various objects, etc.).</p> 

<p align="center"><img src="../../Images/QSEnterActualLOC.png"></p>

<p>Some people do not care to enter detailed actual size data on the Size
Estimating Template.  Those numbers shown above can safely be skipped as long
as you faithfully enter summarized actual size data on the Project Plan
