<h1>Creating a Schedule Step by Step</h1>

<p>The Task &amp; Schedule tool tries to make entering all the data necessary 
for project planning and tracking as painless as possible.  It fills in many 
of the columns automatically. The following discussion will show how to 
create a schedule step by step.</p>

<h2><a name="addTasks"></a>Step 1: Add tasks to the task list</h2>

<p>To create a schedule, you decide what tasks you want included in the 
schedule, and add them with the Add Task button. You can add any node in 
your hierarchy to the task list; it will be added, along with all its 
children, recursively. As an improvement over the traditional task planning 
template, the dashboard displays your task list in a hierarchical fashion. 
You can expand and contract this hierarchical view to get coarser- or 
finer-grained data. </p>

<h3 NO_NUMBER>The relationship between the Project Hierarchy and the
Task &amp; Schedule tool</h3>

<p>All the tasks that are to be tracked within the schedule must come
from your project/task hierarchy, as defined in the
<a href="../../../teamhelp/Topics/EditingTheWBS.html">Work Breakdown
Structure Editor</a> and/or the
<a href="UsingHierarchyEditor.html">hierarchy editor</a>. If you edit your
project/task hierarchy in the future, your changes will automatically
propagate into affected task lists. For example, if you add a node
named &quot;Release 3.0&quot; to a task list, then in the future if
you were to create/delete subtasks underneath &quot;Release 3.0&quot;,
they would automatically appear in the task list / disappear from the
task list.</p>

<p>Changes made in the hierarchy automatically get reflected into the 
schedule, because the schedule is basically a listing of the tasks/projects 
in the dashboard.  However, if you remove a task in the Task &amp; Schedule 
tool, it does <i>NOT</i> get deleted from the task hierarchy of the process 
dashboard.  All you will have done is removed the task from the schedule, 
not deleted it entirely from the dashboard.  Deletion of tasks or projects 
from the dashboard itself must be done from the 
<a href="../../../teamhelp/Topics/EditingTheWBS.html">WBS editor</a> or the
<a href="UsingHierarchyEditor.html">hierarchy editor</a>.</p> 

<h3 NO_NUMBER>Editing the task list</h3>

<p>Once you have added tasks to the task list, you can use the Remove Task
button to remove them.  If you remove a <U>top-level</U> task, it will be
removed from the task list entirely.  (Top-level tasks are the tasks that you
explicitly added using the Add Task button; in the task list, they appear as
immediate children of the root of the tree.)  If you remove a <u>child</u> of
a top-level task, it will be not be deleted from your work hierarchy; instead,
it will just be excluded from the calculations for this EV schedule.  This
option is appropriate if you plan to work on an item in the future, but not
during the current project iteration.  If you have excluded a task in this
way, you can restore it by highlighting the pruned task and clicking the
Restore Task button.</p>

<p><A NAME="flatView"></A>The planned completion dates displayed in the task
list are based upon the order you plan to complete the tasks.  To define the
correct chronological order, check the Flat View checkbox.  This will replace
the hierarchical view of the task list with a flat, chronological view of the
"leaf" tasks that have not yet been completed.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/TaskScheduleFlatView.png"></p>

<p>After you switch into flat view, you can reorder the list of tasks.
Place tasks in approximate chronological order (the first task in
the list should be the one you plan to work on first, and so on).
There are several ways to reorder the tasks:</p>

<ul>

<li>You can highlight a set of tasks, and click the Move Task Up/Down
    buttons.</li>

<li>You can highlight a set of tasks, then drag them up and down to
    move them to a new place in the list.</li>

<li>If the tasks come from a <a href="CreatingProjects.html">team or
    personal project</a> that is using milestones, a "Sort by Milestone"
    button will be shown.  Clicking that button will reorder the list so
    it begins with tasks from the first milestone, followed by tasks
    from the second milestone, and so on.  (Tasks that do not belong to
    any milestone will be sorted last.)</li>

<li>You can highlight a set of tasks, and type <b><tt>Ctrl-C</tt></b>
    to copy the tasks to the clipboard.  Next, highlight another task
    in the list to indicate where you would like the tasks to appear.
    Finally, type <b><tt>Ctrl-V</tt></b> to move the tasks to the
    highlighted position.</li>

<li>For extensive reordering, type <b><tt>Ctrl-A</tt></b> to select
    the entire list of tasks, then <b><tt>Ctrl-C</tt></b> to copy the
    entire list to the clipboard.  Next, open a word processor or
    spreadsheet program, and paste the list of tasks there.  Use that
    application to move and reorder the tasks as desired, keeping one
    task per line.  When you are finished, highlight the list of tasks
    in the other application, and copy them to the clipboard.  Switch
    back to the Task and Schedule window and type
    <b><tt>Ctrl-V</tt></b> to apply the reordering.</li>

</ul>

<p>If you right-click on a task in the task list, a popup menu will appear,
providing access to a number of convenient shortcuts. For example, you can
jump to this task in the time or defect log, or you can copy information
about the task to the clipboard for pasting into another program.</p>

<H2><a name="taskTime"></a>Step 2: Estimate task time </H2>

<P>Once tasks are added to the task list, the dashboard will look up 
information like the planned time, actual time, etc. from the appropriate 
Project Plan Summary forms (if applicable), and display it in the 
appropriate boxes. You can click on any value with a yellow background and 
edit it, and the change will appear immediately on the associated Project 
Plan Summary form.  Similarly, if you edit one of these values on a Project 
Plan Summary form, the new value will automatically appear here in the task 
list.</P>

<h3 NO_NUMBER><A NAME="loe"></A>Level of Effort Tasks</h3>

<P>Often, you may find that you are required to perform
&quot;overhead&quot; tasks, like reading email or attending meetings.
Or, you may be assigned to some ongoing responsibility like keeping
the server running, or monitoring the quality of your team's software
modules.  These tasks are ongoing, and usually have no beginning and
no end.  It doesn't make sense to say that you could ever
&quot;complete&quot; such a task.  In general, you'll spend some
percentage of your available time working on these tasks.  Because of
this, it is generally not possible to estimate how many hours and
minutes of your time the task will require.  If the project lasts one
month, you might spend 10 hours during that time period reading email
- but if the project lasts two months, you'll spend 20 hours.  Because
of this, traditional PSP earned value techniques tell you not to
include these tasks on your task list at all.</p>

<p>The Process Dashboard includes an innovative feature that makes it
easy to include these &quot;level of effort&quot; tasks on your task
list.  Add the task to your task list as usual, and in the
&quot;Planned Time&quot; column, enter a percentage.  For example, if
you think you'll spend 5% of your time reading email, you can add a
task to your task list called &quot;reading email,&quot; and enter
&quot;5%&quot; in the planned time column.  If you indicate that a
particular task is a level of effort task, all of its subtasks will be
considered level of effort tasks as well.</p>

<p>&quot;Level of effort&quot; tasks in your task list will display
differently from regular tasks.  For example, the actual time for
these tasks will be displayed as a percentage (so you can quickly
learn how much time you really spend in meetings!).  Level of effort
tasks do not earn any value, since it doesn't make sense to mark them
&quot;complete.&quot; For the same reason, these tasks will not
contain plan/actual completion dates or percent complete/spent
values.</p>


<H2><a name="calTime"></a>Step 3: Estimate calendar time</H2>

<P>To generate a schedule, the dashboard needs to know how much time you plan 
to spend working on these tasks, and when you plan to spend it. This 
information is displayed in the bottom portion of the window. Each row in the 
table represents a time period. These time periods are consecutive; each time 
period begins when the previous time period ends. The row for the current time
period is displayed with a bold font.</P>

<P>Think about how much time you have available to work on the tasks listed 
in your task list. Describe a time period by entering the dates it will start 
and stop, and in the "PT" (Planned Time) column enter the number of hours you 
think you can spend during that time period.</P> 

<P>Most of the time people have fairly predictable schedules - for example, 
you might say "I'm going to spend 20 hours a week on this until it gets 
done." Since this is the most common situation, the schedule will, by 
default, grow automatically to meet the demand. You don't have to manually 
add rows to your schedule until there are enough hours to cover the tasks - 
instead, the schedule template will automatically duplicate the final row in 
the table until there are enough hours. You can easily see where the 
automatic portion of the schedule starts because the automatic rows are 
displayed with a medium gray font. Thus, the black rows in the schedule 
template are rows that you have manually created/edited, and the gray rows 
are the ones which have been automatically added to meet the time 
requirements.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/TaskScheduleTimes.png"></p>

<p><A NAME="shortSchedule"></A>You can disable this automatic schedule
expansion by entering the word <tt>END</tt> in the planned time column for
a particular row.  This tells the dashboard that you plan to stop work on a
particular date, whether the tasks are completed or not.  The dashboard
will take this end date into account for its calculations; if the schedule
no longer has enough planned hours to finish all of the work, some tasks
may be assigned the planned completion date of "never".</p>

<P>As in the task list, editable cells have a yellow background.  Since time 
periods are contiguous, editing the "To" value on one row will cause the 
"From" value on the following row to change accordingly.  Similarly, editing 
the "From" value on one row will cause the "To" value on the previous row to 
change. If you make changes to the last black row (which is used as a 
template and copied to make all the subsequent gray rows), all of the gray 
rows will be regenerated accordingly. If you edit a value in one of the gray 
rows, it (and all of the rows before it) will become "real", and the row in 
question will become the new "template row" upon which subsequent gray rows 
will be based.</P>

<P>If you need to extend the schedule past its optimal completion date, click 
the Add Row button to create a new row at the bottom of your schedule. The 
Insert Row button will split the currently selected time period into two 
separate rows, while the Delete Row will merge the currently selected time 
period with the one that follows it. Note that it isn't possible to delete 
an automatically generated row. If you want to to force your schedule to 
end early, you should do so by entering <tt>END</tt> in the planned time
column for the final time period, as described
<A HREF="#shortSchedule">above</A>.</P> 

<p>If you have any &quot;level of effort&quot; tasks in your task
list, you'll notice that there are two planned time columns - one for
total planned time, and one for planned &quot;direct&quot time.  Once
you enter how much total time you plan to spend in a period, it will
automatically subtract out time for the level of effort tasks, and
display the remaining time in the &quot;PDT&quot; column.  As your
schedule progresses, you'll also be able to see how much time you're
spending on these &quot;indirect&quot; tasks by looking in the
&quot;%I&quot; column.</p>

<h3 NO_NUMBER><a name="iterativePlanning"></a>Iterative Planning</h3>

<p>Many teams use an iterative approach to develop software.  To create a
schedule for the second or subsequent iteration of your project, you can take
these steps:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Identify the start date of the current iteration, and enter it
        in the "From" column on the first schedule line.</li>

    <li>In the Task &amp; Schedule window, choose &quot;Tools&nbsp;<img
        src="../../Images/rarrow.png">&nbsp;Schedule Options...&quot;</li>

    <li>Select the appropriate option to "rezero" the charts and calculations
        concurrent with the start date of your schedule.</li>

</ol>

These changes will have the following effect on your EV schedule:

<ul>

  <li>Tasks that were marked complete before the start date of the
      schedule will be displayed in sepia tone, and flagged as
      "Previously completed tasks." They will not be included in the
      earned value calculations for this schedule.</li>

  <li>Tasks that were in progress when the iteration began will be
      treated specially.  The dashboard will measure the amount of
      time that was spent on the task before this iteration began, and
      will subtract that amount from the total planned time for the
      task.  The result is the "planned remaining time" - the amount
      of time you plan to spend on the task during <u>this</u>
      iteration.  The earned value for the task for this iteration
      will be based upon its remaining time, rather than its total
      planned time.  (The planned remaining time for the task will be
      displayed in the <a href="UsingTaskSchedule.html#PDT">"PDT"
      column</a> of the task list.)</li>

</ul>


<H2><a name="progress"></a>Step 4: Track your progress</H2>

<P>With the list of tasks and the calendar of available time in place, the 
dashboard will calculate planned completion dates for each task. As you work, 
you should:</P>

<UL>
 <LI>Accurately log time against tasks using the <A 
   HREF="../Execution/PlayPause.html">Play/Pause button</A> and the <A 
   HREF="../Execution/UsingTimeLogEditor.html">Time Log Editor</A>. Time 
   logged against tasks in your task list will appear in the Actual Time
   columns of the task list and schedule list.</LI>
 <LI>Mark tasks complete using the <A 
   HREF="../Execution/CompletionButton.html">Completion Checkbox</A>. When 
   tasks are marked complete, the completion date will appear in the task 
   list, and you will earn the planned value for that task.</LI>
</UL>

<P>While your project is in progress, you can click on the "Chart" button
for access to <a href="TaskScheduleCharts.html">earned value charts</a> and
numerical analyses:</P>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/TaskChartValue.png"></p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/TaskChartStats.png"></p>

<P>If you prefer, you can view this information in HTML, and even export it 
Excel, by clicking the Report button.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you may be interested in seeing these charts and statistics for
a portion of your task list.  The "Filtered Chart" button makes this
possible.  Here are some examples of its use:<ul>

<li>While working on a large project, you might like to see the status of a
particular component.  You would highlight that component in the task list
and press the "Filtered Chart" button.  Earned value charts and statistics
would be displayed for that component only.</li>

<li>While looking at the earned value plan for a team, it might be necessary
to look at the schedule for a single individual - for example, to see when
their work is forecast to complete.  With the team schedule open in the Task
&amp; Schedule window, you could highlight the row corresponding to a
particular individual, and click the filtered chart button.</li>

</ul>
