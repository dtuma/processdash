<H1>Using the Hierarchy Editor</h1>

<p>The Hierarchy Editor is an advanced tool for making manual edits to your
project/task hierarchy.</p>

<p>Most people will never need to use the Hierarchy Editor. Instead, they will
<a href="CreatingProjects.html">create projects</a> (either personally or as
part of a team), then use the
<a href="../../../teamhelp/Topics/EditingTheWBS.html">Work Breakdown Structure
Editor</a> to edit the components and tasks within those projects.</p>

<p>For advanced users, the Hierarchy Editor is provided as a manual editing
tool for:</p>

<ul>
<li>making surgical modifications to the project tree</li>
<li>creating/editing components and tasks outside the scope of a team/personal
    project</li>
<li>creating components that use the
    <a href="../Overview/ProcessScripts.html">PSP processes</a> or
    <a href="../AdvancedTopics/ProcessDefinition/DefiningProcesses.html">legacy
    process templates</a></li>
<li>creating <a href="../AdvancedTopics/MultipleToDateData.html">data rollups</a>
    for PSP processes and legacy process templates</li>
</ul>

<p>The hierarchy editor can be opened by selecting the "Hierarchy" option on
the <a href="../Execution/ConfigureMenu.html#tools">Tools menu</a>.</p>

<P>The Hierarchy Editor allows you to create and delete nodes in your project
tree.  You can create any arbitrary node structure to organize the different
types of projects you are working on, and add component templates to the tree
from the template files provided.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/HierarchyEditorStart.png"></p>

<P>In this image, some child nodes have already been defined under both
"Project" and "Non Project".  You can click the "+" and "-" icons to expand or
collapse the children under a given node.</p>

<h2>The File menu</h2>

<P>The File menu provides the choices of Close, Save, and Revert.  Their 
functionality is pretty self-explanatory:  Close closes the editor, Save 
saves the changes to the dashboard project tree, and Revert will revert the 
project tree back to the state of the last save or to when the editor was 
opened.</p>

<h2>The Edit menu and toolbar</h2>

<P>The Edit menu provides some rudimentary editing control on the project
tree.  It provides the choices of Delete, Rename, Move Up, Move Down, Cut,
Paste, Add Node, and Add Template.  Several of these choices are duplicated
on the Edit toolbar.</P>

<h3>Deleting, moving, and renaming hierarchy nodes</h3>

<P><B>Delete</B> will allow the deletion of a portion of the project tree.  
It deletes the selected node and all its children from the tree.  Be careful; 
deleted nodes and projects cannot be revived once you save your changes. 
Deleted projects will no longer contribute to your historical data. 
Therefore, you probably don't want to delete projects unless they contain no 
real data. If you find that many historical projects are cluttering up your 
hierarchy, your best strategy is to create a node in your hierarchy called 
&quot;Archived Projects,&quot; then use Cut and Paste to move completed 
projects there.</p>

<P>The <b>Rename</b> option will allow you to rename a node in the the project
hierarchy.  When you choose this option, the name of the selected node will
appear as a text entry.  You can type a new name and hit return to finish, or
escape to cancel the name change.  But note: some nodes cannot be renamed
(such as the process elements for Planning, Design, Code, etc).  Also, node
names cannot contain the '/' character.</p>

<P><B>Move Up</B> and <B>Move Down</B> alter the relative position of the
selected node in the tree. The selected node will still have the same parent,
but it will appear earlier or later in the list of children for that parent.
This can help you to organize nodes to your liking - for example, to place
them in the order you plan to work on them.</p>

<P><B>Cut</B> and <B>Paste</B> can be used to move a node, component, or
project from one part of the tree to another. Simply highlight the item you
wish to move, and choose Cut. Then highlight the new parent for the item, 
and choose Paste. The cut node (and all its children) will be relocated 
underneath the new parent. You can then use Move Up and Move Down to 
reposition the node relative to its siblings.</p>

<h3>Organizing your hierarchy</h3>

<P>The <B>Add Node</B> option on the Edit menu allows insertion of
nodes into the tree. Nodes created in this way serve two general
purposes:</p>

<OL>
  <LI>They behave like &quot;folders&quot;, which can contain other nodes
    and/or projects. This allows you to add organization to your work
    projects.</LI>
  <LI>They can be used to track time for process-less tasks like
    &quot;reading email.&quot; If your employer requires you to track your
    time for tasks like these, you can create an entire hierarchy of such
    nodes for time tracking purposes. These nodes will <B><U>not</U></B>
    interfere with your historical PSP component data - they will not
    contribute toward To Date calculations and they will not appear in PROBE 
   linear regressions.</LI>
</OL>

<P>Actual components themselves generally should not be added in this way, but 
can be added via Add Template (see below).  The Add Node menu brings up a 
cascading second menu that provides the choices of Above, Below, and As 
Child.  Again, these are pretty self-explanatory: Above will add a node to 
the tree as a sibling to the selected node, and will place it above the 
selected node; Below will also add a sibling node, but will place it below 
the selected node; As Child will add a node as a child of the selected 
node.</p>

<h3>Creating components that follow a defined legacy process</h3>

<P>The <B>Add Template</B> option on the hierarchy menu allows
insertion of a process template into the tree.  Use this choice when
you are ready to define a component.  The Add Template menu brings up a
cascading second menu that provides choices among the various defined
processes.  By default, two simple templates are provided:
<a href="#generic">Generic</a> and <a href="#timer">Timer</a>.  If you have
<a href="../Overview/HowToInstall.html#addon">installed the PSP process
definitions</a>, you will also see the 7 PSP process
levels, along with <A HREF="../AdvancedTopics/MultipleToDateData.html">Rollup
PSP Data</A>.  If you have installed any other add-on process sets, other
choices will appear as well.  For more information about the processes and
their scripts, see the <a href="../Overview/ProcessScripts.html">process
scripts</A> help topic.</p>

<P>When you insert a component template into the hierarchy, it will initially
have a generic name like &quot;PSP2.1&quot;. You should feel free to change
its name immediately to something more descriptive. (To make dashboard
operation clear, this help document sometimes displays components with names
like &quot;PSP0&quot;, but such bland component names are neither required
nor expected for actual use.)</p>


<h2>Process templates</h2>

<P>When a process template is added, all the process phase elements that are 
defined for that process will be automatically added as children.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/HierarchyEditorShowAddedPSP0.png"></p>

<P>These process phases cannot be edited in any way (with a couple 
exceptions).  If a process phase is selected and the Edit menu is clicked, 
the menu will show all entries greyed out and disabled.  This is to protect 
the integrity of the processes themselves.</p>

<h2>Processes PSP0 - PSP1.1</h2>
<P><a href="../Overview/ProcessScripts.html">PSP processes</a>
PSP0 through PSP1.1 do not provide for design or code 
reviews, as those improvements are introduced in PSP level 2.  However, the 
dashboard will allow you to add design and or code reviews to these low level 
PSP processes if you choose.  If you pick on a component that was defined from 
the PSP0, PSP0.1, PSP1, or PSP1.1 process templates and then choose the "Add
Template" menu you will see Design Review and Code Review choices.  Either of
these can be added to the process.  They will be automatically inserted in the
correct places in the process phase order.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/HierarchyEditorShowPSP0Reviews.png"></p>

<p>Once you insert a Design Review or Code Review phase, it will appear in
the process scripts and forms for the component. If you later change your mind 
and decide you don't want the review phase after all, you can highlight it 
and choose Delete from the Edit menu.</p> 

<a name="cyclic"></a><h2>The PSP3 process</h2>
<P>The <a href="../Overview/ProcessScripts.html">PSP3 process</a> is a
cyclic development process.  As such, it provides a 
basic structure for the whole component and also provides the ability to add 
development cycles.  When a PSP3 process is added to the hierarchy, it will 
have the basic skeletal structure defined (Planning, High Level Design, High 
Level Design Review, and Postmortem phases), along with one PSP3 cycle.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/HierarchyEditorShowEmptyPSP3.png"></p>

<P>Once you decide upon your cyclical development strategy, you should create 
additional cycles underneath the PSP3 component. Each of these cycles will 
contain the other PSP3 process phases (Design, Design Review, Code, Code 
Review, Compile, Test, and Reassessment).  The PSP3 cycles are added just 
like the PSP3 component itself, via the "Add Template" menu.  When a PSP3 based 
component is selected and the Edit menu is chosen, the Add Template menu item 
will have only one available choice: PSP3cycle.  The cycle will be placed 
appropriately before the Postmortem step.  You can input as many cycles as 
you would like in this manner.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/HierarchyEditorShowPSP3WithCycle.png"></p>

<h2><A name="generic"></A>The "generic" process template</h2>
<P>Very much of the methodology that is employed by the PSP can be used in 
other endeavors.  Any kind of work that has measurable time, size, and/or
defects can probably benefit from a PSP-like process.  The generic process 
template gives estimation, measurement, and defect tracking support for other 
work efforts.</p>

<P>When you create a component based on the generic process in the hierarchy
editor, it will initially contain only a planning phase and a postmortem
phase.  You can then add additional phases (and give them any names that you
want) by selecting the node corresponding to the generic component, then
selecting "Generic Phase" from the "Add Template" menu:</P>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/ShowAddGenericPhase.png"></p>

<P>The generic process then creates a tailored plan summary form.  It
allows entry of time and size estimates, and even lets you enter the unit of
size measurement.  For example, you could run the generic process to measure
and track your progress as you write a technical paper.  The size unit would
end up being something related to the work of writing (perhaps pages).  The
generic process would capture your productivity rates and allow you to enter
defects.  If you have installed the add-on with PSP process materials, the
Size Estimating Template and PROBE Wizard will also be available to provide
support for the estimation process.</p>

<h2><A name="timer"></A>The "timer" process script</h2>

<P>The timer process allows for estimating and measuring activities that have 
only a time aspect to them.  If you regularly perform some kind of task that 
pretty much remains the same each time, you could record estimates and times 
for that task to attempt to provide some engineering discipline.</p>
