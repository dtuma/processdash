<H1>Using the Hierarchy Editor</h1>

<P>The Hierarchy Editor can be used to create a work breakdown structure for
personal work which is not a part of a team project.</p>

<p><b>Please Note:</b> if you are participating on a team project, you will
rarely need to use this hierarchy editor.  Instead, you will use the Team
Project <a href="../../../teamhelp/Topics/EditingTheWBS.html">Work Breakdown
Structure Editor</a>.  The remainder of this help topic applies to
<u>personal</u> work, outside the scope of a team project.</p>

<p>The personal Hierarchy Editor allows you to define a hierarchical
collection of tasks that need to be performed, and to define the process
elements that will be used for those tasks.</P>

<p>The hierarchy editor can be opened by selecting the "Hierarchy" option on
the <a href="../Execution/ConfigureMenu.html#tools">Tools menu</a>.</p>

<P>The Hierarchy Editor allows you to create and delete nodes in a project
tree.  You can create any arbitrary node structure to organize the different
types of projects you are working on, and add project templates to the tree
from the template files provided.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/HierarchyEditorStart.png"></p>

<P>In this image, some child nodes have already been defined under
both "Project" and "Non Project".  When the little tree control is
pointing to the right, it indicates that the node can be expanded.
Clicking the tree control will cause the expansion of the tree.  When
the control is pointing down, it indicates that the node is showing
its expansion and can be collapsed.</p>

<h2>The File menu</h2>

<P>The File menu provides the choices of Close, Save, and Revert.  Their 
functionality is pretty self-explanatory:  Close closes the editor, Save 
saves the changes to the dashboard project tree, and Revert will revert the 
project tree back to the state of the last save or to when the editor was 
opened.</p>

<h2>The Edit menu and toolbar</h2>

<P>The Edit menu provides some rudimentary editing control on the project
hierarchy.  It provides the choices of Delete, Rename, Move Up, Move Down, Cut,
Paste, Add Node, and Add Template.  Several of these choices are duplicated
on the Edit toolbar.</P>

<h3>Deleting, moving, and renaming hierarchy nodes</h3>

<P><B>Delete</B> will allow the deletion of a portion of the project tree.  
It deletes the selected node and all its children from the tree.  Be careful; 
deleted nodes and projects cannot be revived once you save your changes. 
Deleted projects will no longer contribute to your historical data. 
Therefore, you probably don't want to delete projects unless they contain no 
real data. If you find that many historical projects are cluttering up your 
hierarchy, your best strategy is to create a node in your hierarchy called 
&quot;Archived Projects,&quot; then use Cut and Paste to move completed 
projects there.</p>

<P>The <b>Rename</b> option will allow you to rename a node in the the project
hierarchy.  When you choose this option, the name of the selected node will
appear as a text entry.  You can type a new name and hit return to finish, or
escape to cancel the name change.  But note: some nodes cannot be renamed
(such as the process elements for Planning, Design, Code, etc).  Also, node
names cannot contain the '/' character.</p>

<P><B>Move Up</B> and <B>Move Down</B> alter the relative position of the 
selected node in the tree. The selected node will still have the same parent, 
but it will appear earlier or later in the list of children for that parent. 
Since the <A HREF="UsingTaskSchedule.html">task and schedule</A> feature 
assumes that tasks will be performed in hierarchy order, Move Up and Move 
Down can help rearrange nodes so they appear in the order you plan to work on 
them.</p>

<P><B>Cut</B> and <B>Paste</B> can be used to move a node / project from one 
part of the tree to another. Simply highlight the node or project you wish to 
move, and choose Cut. Then highlight the new parent for the node or project, 
and choose Paste. The cut node (and all its children) will be relocated 
underneath the new parent. You can then use Move Up and Move Down to 
reposition the node relative to its siblings.</p>

<h3>Organizing your hierarchy</h3>

<P>The <B>Add Node</B> option on the Edit menu allows insertion of
nodes into the tree. Nodes created in this way serve two general
purposes:</p>

<OL>
  <LI>They behave like &quot;folders&quot;, which can contain other nodes
    and/or projects. This allows you to add organization to your work
    projects.</LI>
  <LI>They can be used to track time for process-less tasks like
    &quot;reading email.&quot; If your employer requires you to track your
    time for tasks like these, you can create an entire hierarchy of such
    nodes for time tracking purposes. These nodes will <B><U>not</U></B>
    interfere with your historical PSP project data - they will not
    contribute toward To Date calculations and they will not appear in PROBE 
   linear regressions.</LI>
</OL>

<P>Actual projects themselves should <em>NOT</em> be added in this way, but 
should be added via Add Template (see below).  The Add Node menu brings up a 
cascading second menu that provides the choices of Above, Below, and As 
Child.  Again, these are pretty self-explanatory: Above will add a node to 
the tree as a sibling to the selected node, and will place it above the 
selected node; Below will also add a sibling node, but will place it below 
the selected node; As Child will add a node as a child of the selected 
node.</p>

<h3>Creating projects that follow a defined process</h3>

<P>The <B>Add Template</B> option on the hierarchy menu allows
insertion of a process template into the tree.  Use this choice when
you are ready to define a project.  The Add Template menu brings up a
cascading second menu that provides choices among the various defined
processes.  By default, two simple templates are provided:
<a href="../Overview/ProcessScripts.html#generic">Generic</a> and
<a href="../Overview/ProcessScripts.html#timer">Timer</a>.  If you have
<a href="../Overview/HowToInstall.html#addon">installed the PSP process
definitions</a>, you will also see the 7 PSP process
levels, along with <A HREF="../AdvancedTopics/MultipleToDateData.html">Rollup
PSP Data</A>.  If you have installed any other add-on process sets, other
choices will appear as well.  For more information about the processes and
their scripts, see the <a href="../Overview/ProcessScripts.html">process
scripts</A> help topic.</p>

<P>When you insert a project template into the hierarchy, it will initially
have a generic name like &quot;PSP2.1&quot;. You should feel free to change
its name immediately to something more descriptive. (To make dashboard
operation clear, this help document sometimes displays projects with names
like &quot;PSP0&quot;, but such bland project names are neither required
nor expected for actual use.)</p>


<h2>Process templates</h2>

<P>When a process template is added, all the process phase elements that are 
defined for that process will be automatically added as children.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/HierarchyEditorShowAddedPSP0.png"></p>

<P>These process phases cannot be edited in any way (with a couple 
exceptions).  If a process phase is selected and the Edit menu is clicked, 
the menu will show all entries greyed out and disabled.  This is to protect 
the integrity of the processes themselves.</p>

<h2>Processes PSP0 - PSP1.1</h2>
<P><a href="../Overview/ProcessScripts.html">PSP processes</a>
PSP0 through PSP1.1 do not provide for design or code 
reviews, as those improvements are introduced in PSP level 2.  However, the 
dashboard will allow you to add design and or code reviews to these low level 
PSP processes if you choose.  If you pick on a project that was defined from 
the PSP0, PSP0.1, PSP1, or PSP1.1 process templates and then choose the "Add
Template" menu you will see Design Review and Code Review choices.  Either of
these can be added to the process.  They will be automatically inserted in the
correct places in the process phase order.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/HierarchyEditorShowPSP0Reviews.png"></p>

<p>Once you insert a Design Review or Code Review phase, it will appear in
the process scripts and forms for the project. If you later change your mind 
and decide you don't want the review phase after all, you can highlight it 
and choose Delete from the Edit menu.</p> 

<a name="cyclic"></a><h2>The PSP3 process</h2>
<P>The <a href="../Overview/ProcessScripts.html">PSP3 process</a> is a
cyclic development process.  As such, it provides a 
basic structure for the whole project and also provides the ability to add 
development cycles.  When a PSP3 process is added to the hierarchy, it will 
have the basic skeletal structure defined (Planning, High Level Design, High 
Level Design Review, and Postmortem phases), along with one PSP3 cycle.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/HierarchyEditorShowEmptyPSP3.png"></p>

<P>Once you decide upon your cyclical development strategy, you should create 
additional cycles underneath the PSP3 project. Each of these cycles will 
contain the other PSP3 process phases (Design, Design Review, Code, Code 
Review, Compile, Test, and Reassessment).  The PSP3 cycles are added just 
like the PSP3 project itself, via the "Add Template" menu.  When a PSP3 based 
project is selected and the Edit menu is chosen, the Add Template menu item 
will have only one available choice: PSP3cycle.  The cycle will be placed 
appropriately before the Postmortem step.  You can input as many cycles as 
you would like in this manner.</p>
