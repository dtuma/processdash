<H1>Entering Process Data</H1>
<P>There are two main ways of entering data into the Process Dashboard.  The 
first is through various input tools and dialogs provided by the dashboard 
(e.g. the <a href="../Execution/EnteringDefects.html">defect dialog</a>, the 
<A HREF="../Execution/UsingTimeLogEditor.html">time log editor</A>, etc.).</p>

<p>The second is through various process forms.  The scripts and forms are 
provided through an integrated web interface.  See the <a 
href="../Execution/AccessingScripts.html">Accessing Process Scripts</a> help 
topic for more info on how to access the scripts and forms.  To find out more 
information about the different process scripts and forms that are available, 
see the <a href="../Overview/ProcessScripts.html">process scripts</a> help 
topic.</p>


<h2>The nature of the dashboard forms</h2>
<P>The dashboard forms are implemented via static and sometimes dynamic HTML 
pages. Unlike the HTML forms you see on the internet, the forms on these HTML 
pages are "live" at all times, much like a spreadsheet. You can type values 
in the input fields and other fields will recalculate automatically, even if 
those fields are in different browser windows. There is no need to press any 
kind of "submit data" button.</P> 

<P>After typing in a value, you must generally "leave" that input field to 
signal that you are finished entering information. Pressing the "Tab" key (to 
move to the next input field) or clicking anywhere else on the page is 
generally sufficient. As soon as the "input cursor" leaves the field in 
question, the dashboard will automatically pick up your data, recalculate 
related data items, and save your data for future sessions.</P>

<P>If you enter an invalid value for a data item (for example, typing "foo" 
in an input field that is expecting a number), the dashboard will reject the 
invalid value and restore the previous value for that input field.</P>

<p>The dashboard uses various visual cues to show you where data is missing 
or where a calculated value could not be completed.  Here is a partial screen 
shot of a dashboard form that shows several of the ways the 
dashboard indicates incomplete or bad data:</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/ShowMissingFields.png"></p>

<P><a name="missing"></a>When a required data value is <I>missing</I>, the 
dashboard will display "<code>?????</code>". This is an indication that you 
still need to enter a value for that data item. Therefore, you should ensure 
that there are no "<code>?????</code>" symbols in the Plan column of your 
project plan summary before marking the Planning phase complete. Similarly, 
make certain you fill in all missing values in the Actual column of your 
project plan summary before marking the project complete.</P>

<P>If the dashboard cannot recalculate a formula because the formula 
references a missing ("<code>?????</code>") or otherwise invalid data value, 
it will display "<code>#VALUE!</code>" as the result of the calculation.  
When you see "<code>#VALUE!</code>" in a dashboard form, it almost 
<I>always</I> means that there is a "<code>?????</code>" field somewhere that 
you still need to fill in.</P>

<P>If the dashboard recalculates a formula and encounters a divide-by-zero 
error, it will display "<code>#DIV/0!</code>" as the result of the 
calculation. Divide-by-zero errors are common when you first begin using the 
dashboard, since you will not have any historical data.</P> 

<P>To make all this possible, the dashboard software actually contains a very 
small HTTP server embedded within it.  This server allows communication 
between the HTML pages and the process data that is tracked by the 
dashboard.  If you close the dashboard program while one of the HTML forms is 
open, the form will reset and display "<code>NO CONNECTION</code>". You can 
reestablish the connection simply by restarting the dashboard, then telling 
your browser to reload the HTML page.</P>

<a name="unlock"></a><h2>Read-only data fields</h2>

<P>The Process Dashboard automatically calculates many data elements for
you.  Normally, these calculated data values are not directly editable, but
rather they will update when other data elements to which they are related
get updated.  If you are using a recent web browser, these values are
displayed with a grey background.</p>

<P>Sometimes you may decide that you want to override one or more of these 
calculated values.  You can "unlock" these read-only data elements by 
clicking on the "<u>Unlock read-only data</u>" link at the bottom of the 
page.  Unlocking read-only data will make all the elements on the page 
editable, allowing you to override calculated values with your own.</p> 

<P>Unlocking read-only data is useful for times when you intentionally want 
to override a calculation, but it is not without risk.  Once you have 
overridden a calculation, it will no longer automatically update in response 
to changes in related data items.  In addition, related calculations may no 
longer add up like you would normally expect.  Therefore, this feature should 
be used with caution.</p> 

<p>After you have overridden a calculation with some value, you may decide 
that you want the old calculation back.  Just type <code>DEFAULT</code> in 
the input field, and when you leave the field the old calculation will be 
restored.</p>

<a name="dataFreezing"></a><H2>Frozen Calculations</H2>

<P>For some component types, the dashboard will "freeze" appropriate pieces of
data when the corresponding process phase is marked as completed.  The two
points where this happens are at the end of the Planning phase and at the
completion of the component.</p>

<P>For example, when you are planning your component with a PSP process,
the dashboard will use your historical data to help you create an estimate of 
how your total time will be distributed across the process phases.  Once you 
click the completion checkbox to complete the planning phase, all your 
Planned data will be baselined. The estimates you entered for size and time, 
along with all the calculated computed data elements for estimated data, will 
be frozen so that your planned data will always stay constant.</p>

<P>Similarly, when you mark the component complete, the To Date numbers will be 
brought up to date and frozen.  This will enable you to view this report 
again in the future without having the To Date numbers changing in the 
report.</p>

<P>One side effect of the freezing of data is that if you want to change
your time or size estimate, you will have to navigate back to the Planning
phase and mark it as incomplete by clicking the completion checkbox again.
Once it has been marked as incomplete the dashboard will allow you to enter
a different estimate.</p>

<p>The same is true of the To Date items on the report.  If you navigate back
to an old component and start logging time to it, the Actual columns will
update as required, but the To Date columns will not.  You will need to mark
the component as incomplete so that the To Date items will thaw out and
recalculate.</p>

<p>The Project Completion checkbox is located on the Project Plan Summary 
form.</p>

<a name="exporting"></a><h2>Exporting form data</h2>

<p>When you open a dashboard form, the form connects to the process dashboard
to retrieve the most up-to-date values for all the data elements on the page.
If you choose the &quot;File <img src="../../Images/rarrow.png"> Save&quot;
option from your browser, you will find that only the form is saved; the values
contained in the form are not.  If you want to save an electronic copy of a
dashboard form (for example, to email to a coworker, or to save with project
documentation), click the "Export to HTML" link at the bottom of the page.  The
dashboard will create an HTML version of the form containing a <i>snapshot</i>
of your data.  This HTML snapshot can be saved using the &quot;File <img
src="../../Images/rarrow.png"> Save&quot; option of your browser.</p>

<p>If you would like to perform additional analysis on the data in a 
dashboard form, use the "Export to Excel" link at the bottom of the page. 
This will open the form in Excel, where you can reference the data in Excel 
charts and equations. For more information on the Excel export feature, see 
the <A HREF="../PostmortemAnalysis/ExportingData.html#excel">Exporting your 
data</A> help topic.</p>

<p><b>Important:</b> the Excel version of the form contains <i>exported</i> 
data only.  If you edit values in the Excel spreadsheet, your changes will 
not be imported back into the Process Dashboard. To change a data value in 
the Process Dashboard, you must make the change in a dashboard form.</p>
