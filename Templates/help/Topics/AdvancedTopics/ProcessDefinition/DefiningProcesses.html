<p>The instructions below describe how to build customized XML process
templates.  But these templates are now considered <b>legacy
functionality</b>, because they have a number of serious limitations.  For
example, they cannot be modified without invalidating historical data, and
they can only be used for personal work, not by teams.</p>
 
<p>Fortunately,
<a href="../../../../teamhelp/Topics/EditWorkflows.html">custom workflows</a>
in <a href="../../Planning/CreatingProjects.html">team/personal projects</a>
do not have those limitations.  Accordingly, users are strongly encouraged to
create a team or personal project, then use workflows in their WBS to define
custom processes.</p>

<!-- How to define your own custom process
   * An overview of the process definition architecture: explain the three
     pieces to the puzzle and how they fit together:
      * "-template.xml" files define the *structure* of the process
      * optional HTML files provide process scripts and forms
      * optional data files define custom calculations for your process
     Also explain how the dashboard locates these files (i.e., where should
     you put these files, and how can you share them with your co-workers) -->


<P>The dashboard has been designed from the ground up to support custom 
processes.  The PSP scripts and forms that you see are not hard-coded into 
the tool. Instead, they are dynamically loaded from simple HTML and text 
files.  Thus, it is possible to create your own custom process scripts, 
forms, and data that will be dynamically integrated into the dashboard.</P>

<P>The dashboard process definition framework provides a great deal of power
for process automation.  To create a custom personal process definition, just
follow these steps:</P>

</OL>

<H2><A NAME="ProcessStructure">Step 1: Identify your process structure</A></H2>

<P>What steps do you want to include in your process? The standard PSP0 
process, of course, includes the phases Planning, Design, Code, Compile, 
Test, and Postmortem. Think through your process and decide upon the list of 
phases that your process will include.</P>

<P>Think this through carefully. Remember how you had to restart your "To 
Date" data when you graduated from PSP1.1 to PSP2? The same truth applies 
here. Once you have defined a custom process and used it in the dashboard, 
even slight changes to the process definition will invalidate all your 
historical data. In fact, once you create a process definition and use it to 
perform a project, you can no longer even change the names of the phases 
without losing historical data.</P>

<P>If your process definition is still immature and evolving, it is probably 
better to use the <A 
HREF="../../Planning/UsingHierarchyEditor.html#generic">Generic process</A> for a 
while. As you begin creating your own custom process definitions, the 
flexibility of the generic process will allow you to radically change your 
process from one task to the next in response to process improvement 
proposals.  Once you decide upon and finalize the <u>list of phases</u> in 
your process, you are ready to begin using a custom process.</P>

<P>Some guidelines to consider as you identify your process phases:</P>

<P><B>Don't subdivide things too far.</B> Take a look at the PSP processes, 
for example. They will define a single phase like Planning, even though it 
contains several different steps (obtain requirements, make size estimate, 
make resource estimate, create schedule, etc.). The PSP process definition 
does not break each of these steps into its own phase! Herein lies the 
difference between a <B>phase</B> and an <B>activity</B>. By carefully 
defining the high level phases in the process, Watts Humphrey was free to 
incorporate process improvements simply by altering the set of activities in 
each phase. Remember also that when you enact your process, you will have to 
collect time and defect data with phase-level granularity. If you break your 
process up into a zillion tasks that each take only a minute, you will go 
crazy just trying to log time accurately. Therefore, if your custom process
contains more than a dozen phases, it's most likely subdivided too far.</P>

<P>Here's another way to think about this: the dashboard is a useful tool
because it seamlessly integrates your <b>process script</b> and your <b>metrics
collection framework</b>. By tying the two things together, you have all the
tools you need at your fingertips to enact the process. But as a result, this
means that when you create a custom dashboard process, you must understand and
think about your custom process from both perspectives. Many people are able to
easily think up a script for their process, but you must <u>also</u> take time
to think about your metrics collection framework. The phases you choose in your
custom process define the "buckets" in your metrics collection
framework. If you choose these phases thoughtfully, it will allow room for your
process to grow and improve. On the other hand, if you choose phases that
correspond one-to-one with activities in your process, you may find that your
custom process quickly becomes obsolete.</P>

<P><B>Choose abbreviations for long phase names.</B> When you write your 
process script, you may have phases with verbose names like "High Level 
Design Review". Realize that if you use this long phase name, the main 
dashboard window is going to stretch halfway across your screen whenever you 
navigate to that phase. An abbreviation like "HLD Review" may be more 
appropriate. You can still refer to the phase by its unabbreviated name when 
you create your HTML process scripts and forms.</P>

<P><B>Include Planning and Postmortem phases.</B> In his book, Watts Humphrey
encourages you to always include these phases in any process you define.  The 
planning phase serves an obvious purpose of estimating size, cost, schedule, 
risk, etc. The postmortem phase allows you to ensure accurate collection of 
data and capture process improvement proposals.</P> 

<H2><A NAME="XmlDef">Step 2: Create an XML definition for your process</A></H2>

<P>The dashboard understands a process structure that is described in XML 
format. <B>The discussion below assumes that you are familiar with XML.</B> 
If this is not the case, please go read a nice tutorial on XML before 
proceeding!!</P> 

<P>Here is an example of an XML description file for a PSP0 process:</P>
<TABLE BORDER="1" WIDTH="100%">
 <TR>
  <TD WIDTH="100%">
   <PRE>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">&lt;?xml version='1.0'?&gt;

&lt;dashboard-process-template&gt;</FONT>
   &lt;template name="PSP0" defectLog="true"&gt;
      &lt;phase name="Planning"   type="plan"/&gt;
      &lt;phase name="Design"     type="dld"/&gt;
      &lt;phase name="Code"       type="code"/&gt;
      &lt;phase name="Compile"    type="comp"/&gt;
      &lt;phase name="Test"       type="ut"/&gt;
      &lt;phase name="Postmortem" type="pm"/&gt;
   &lt;/template&gt;
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">&lt;/dashboard-process-template&gt;</FONT></PRE></TD>
 </TR>
</TABLE>

<P>The file begins and ends with the header and footer (which appear in blue 
above). Between the header and footer, any number of process templates can be 
defined. (The file above only defines one process template.)</P>

<P>A process definition begins with the <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> tag and 
ends with <code>&lt;/template&gt;</code>. The template tag must have a 
"<code>name</code>" attribute, and all of the processes you define must have 
<B>unique</B> names. Also, template names cannot contain the "/" character. 
If you will be collecting defects with your process, you should include the 
"<CODE>defectLog</CODE>" attribute as shown above (and remember that XML is 
case-sensitive, so "<CODE>defect<U><B>l</B></U>og</CODE>" will not work).</P>

<P>Between the <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> tags, list the phases in order. 
Each phase is described with a <code>&lt;phase&gt;</code> tag. The phase tag 
must have a "<code>name</code>" attribute, and all of the phase names must be 
<B>unique</B>. As was true of template names, phase names cannot contain the 
"/" character. The phase type can optionally be specified with the 
"<CODE>type</CODE>" attribute. The following is a list of valid types that 
can be specified:</p>


<UL>
 <LI><B>Appraisal phase types:</B> <tt>appraisal reqinsp hldr hldrinsp dldr 
   dldinsp cr codeinsp</tt></LI>
 <LI><B>Failure phase types:</B> <tt>failure comp ut it st at pl</tt></LI>
 <LI><B>Overhead phase types:</B> <tt>mgmt strat plan pm</tt></LI>
 <LI><B>Development phase types:</B> <tt>req stp itp td hld dld code
   doc</tt></LI>
</UL>

<P>Phase types are not required. Even if you specify the phase type for one 
phase, you can omit it for others. If you do specify phase types, the 
dashboard will be able to intelligently calculate metrics like Yield, A/FR, 
and Defect removal efficiency.</P> 

<H2><A NAME="XmlDesc">Step 3: Save your XML process descriptor</A></H2>

<P>Once your XML process descriptor is complete, it is time to save it 
somewhere <A HREF="HowDashboardFindsFiles.html#FindFiles">where the dashboard 
can find it</A>. Follow these steps:</P>

<ol>
 <li>Choose &quot;<img src="../../../Images/cmenu.png"> &rarr; Help &rarr;
   About,&quot; and click the "Configuration" tab.  Just above the
   list of add-ons, a paragraph will tell you where the Process Dashboard
   is installed. Find that directory on your computer.  It should contain a
   small number of files, including one called "pspdash.jar".</li>
 <li>Underneath this directory, create a subdirectory called "Templates".</li>
 <li>Save your XML process descriptor in that Templates directory. 
   <B>Important:</B> you must give your XML process descriptor a filename 
   ending with "<code><b>-template.xml</b></code>" to signal to the dashboard 
   that this is an XML process template descriptor.  If you do not choose a 
   filename ending with "<code><b>-template.xml</b></code>", your process 
   descriptor will be ignored.</li>
</ol>

<P>This is the simplest place to put your XML process descriptor. Of course, 
if you want to share your process with team members, you may want to put it 
somewhere else. See the section on <A 
HREF="HowDashboardFindsFiles.html#FindFiles">how the dashboard finds process 
files</A> for more information. Keep in mind that the dashboard will search 
for "<code><b>-template.xml</b></code>" files in the "Templates" directories 
only - subdirectories will not be searched.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Restart">Step 4: Restart the dashboard</A></H2>

<P>Once your XML process descriptor is in place, it is necessary to shut down 
the dashboard and restart it for the new process to be found.  Once found, 
you will automatically have:</P> 

<UL>
 <LI>A template on the hierarchy editor's "Add Template" menu for your 
   process</LI>
 <LI>A template on the hierarchy editor's "Add Template" menu for <B>rolling 
   up</B> data from your process</LI>
 <LI>A custom project plan summary form for your process</LI>
</UL>

<h2>Advanced/Optional: Defining HTML scripts</h2>

<P>Defining HTML scripts for your process and its phases is easy to
do. Here is an example of an XML description file for a PSP0 process,
with HTML script definitions added. The text in blue is identical to
the example shown in step 2 above; the black text illustrates the
additions:</P>

<TABLE BORDER="1" WIDTH="100%">
 <TR>
  <TD WIDTH="100%">
   <PRE>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">&lt;?xml version='1.0'?&gt;

&lt;dashboard-process-template&gt;
   &lt;template name="PSP0" defectLog="true"
             </FONT>htmlID="top"<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">&gt;</FONT>
   
      &lt;html ID="sum"
            title="Project Plan Summary"
	    href="dash/summary.shtm"/&gt;
      &lt;html ID="top"
            title="PSP0 Process Script"
	    href="psp0/script.html"/&gt;
      &lt;html ID="plan"
            title="PSP0 Planning Script"
	    href="psp0/planning.html"/&gt;
      &lt;html ID="dev"
            title="PSP0 Development Script"
	    href="psp0/develop.html"/&gt;
      &lt;html ID="pm"
            title="PSP0 Postmortem Script"
	    href="psp0/postmort.html"/&gt;

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">      &lt;phase name="Planning"   type="plan"
             </FONT>htmlID="plan"<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">/&gt;
      &lt;phase name="Design"     type="dld"
             </FONT>htmlID="dev"<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">/&gt;
      &lt;phase name="Code"       type="code"
             </FONT>htmlID="dev"<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">/&gt;
      &lt;phase name="Compile"    type="comp"
             </FONT>htmlID="dev"<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">/&gt;
      &lt;phase name="Test"       type="ut"
             </FONT>htmlID="dev"<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">/&gt;
      &lt;phase name="Postmortem" type="pm"
             </FONT>htmlID="pm"<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">/&gt;
   &lt;/template&gt;
&lt;/dashboard-process-template&gt;</FONT></PRE></TD>
 </TR>
</TABLE>

<P>So right after your <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> tag, you list all
the HTML pages that you want to appear on the script button's drop
down menu, in order. (Note that you don't have to list every HTML page
used by your process - just the ones that you want to appear on the
script button menu.) For each HTML page, you state:</P>

<ul>

  <li>the title (which should usually match the
    <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> of the HTML page in question); this
    title will be displayed in the script button's drop-down menu</li>

  <li>the href to the page, relative to the "Templates" directory</li>

  <li>a unique ID for the HTML page (these only need to be unique
    within a given process <code>&lt;template&gt;</code>)</li>

</ul>

<p>Then you (optionally) associate these HTML pages with the phases by
adding an <code>htmlID</code> attribute which names the ID of the HTML
page associated with that phase. You can have HTML pages that aren't
associated with any phase, and vice versa. You can even associate an
HTML page with the <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> tag, as shown above;
then any phases which don't specify an <code>htmlID</code> of their
own will inherit that <code>htmlID</code>.</p>

<p>Of course, before the dashboard will be able to open any of these
HTML pages, you must actually create them and place them appropriately
underneath the "Templates" directory. You can use your favorite HTML
editor to create these pages; if you have a program like Microsoft
Word, it is capable of saving files in HTML format. Since the hrefs
are interpreted relative to the "Templates" directory, for this
example we would need to create a directory called "psp0" underneath
the "Templates" directory, and put files in that directory called
"script.html", "planning.html", "develop.html", and
"postmort.html".</p>

<p>The file "dash/summary.shtm" is special. It names an HTML file that
is shipped with the dashboard. When you don't name any HTML files for
your process, the dashboard assigns it "dash/summary.shtm" by default.
(This is why you could create an XML template file, specify no HTML
files, and still get a project plan summary form automatically.)
However, as soon as you include <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tags in your
template definition, the dashboard will no longer automatically assign
it "dash/summary.shtm", so you must manually include this entry to
ensure that you can view a plan summary form for your process.</p>
