<h1>Personal Data Storage Options</h1>

<p>When you <a href="../Overview/HowToInstall.html">install</a> the
Process Dashboard, the installer will ask you to select a directory
where your personal data will be stored.  Time and defect log entries,
task completion dates, and all other personal data you enter will be
saved into this directory.  You can find out the exact location of
your data directory by choosing "&equiv; &rarr; Help &rarr; About
Process Dashboard," then clicking on the Configuration tab.</p>

<p>The installer will suggest a reasonable default location for your
data directory, which you may accept.  But there are many different
possibilities, which are described below.</p>

<h2><a name="local"></a>Local Hard Drive</h2>

<p>By default, the installer will suggest a data directory location on
your local hard drive.  This option is the simplest.  Here are some of
the tradeoffs of this approach:</p>

<table style="margin-left:20px; border-spacing:5px 10px; 
              border-collapse:separate">

<tr valign="top"><td><b>PRO:</b></td>
<td>Your personal data is always accessible on this computer.  You can
open your personal dashboard and collect data at any time, even if you
have no network connection.</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>PRO:</b></td>
<td>Local storage helps with data privacy: other people cannot look at
your detailed personal data if they cannot read your data
files.</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>CON:</b></td>
<td>Your personal data is only accessible from one computer.  If you
regularly work on different computers throughout the day, you'll have
to select one computer where you will run the Process Dashboard.  If
you are away from that selected computer, you won't be able to collect
data.</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>CON:</b></td>
<td>Your data can be lost if your hard drive crashes, because your
data directory is the <b>only</b> place that contains a complete copy
of all your personal data.  (It's a common misconception that the data
you collect for a team project might be stored in the WBS Editor or
the Team Dashboard; but that is <b>incorrect</b>.  Those locations
only contain the summaries they need to generate team rollups.)  You
can mitigate this risk by configuring an
<a href="BackupData.html#automatic">automatic, external backup</a> of
your data.</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>NOTE:</b></td>
<td>Mac OS X provides special operating-system protections for the
Documents directory.  Depending on the version of Mac OS X you are
running, the dashboard may not be allowed to read and write files that
appear under Documents.  As a result, you may need to place your
personal dashboard data somewhere
under <tt style="white-space:nowrap">~/Library/Process Dashboard</tt>.
The installer will suggest this as the default; if you choose another
location, be aware that Documents and its subfolders are probably
off-limits.</td>

</table>



<h2><a name="network"></a>Network Directory</h2>

<p>If access from more than one computer is important to you, you can
create a personal data directory on a network file server.  The general
steps are:</p>

<ol>

<li>Obtain access to a folder on a network file server.</li>

<li>Map or mount the network file server so it is visible to your
local computer (for example, as a new lettered drive in Windows, or as
a folder under Volumes in Mac OS X).</li>

<li>Create a new, empty folder in that area for your personal data.</li>

<li>When installing the dashboard, enter the path to that folder as
the location of your personal data.</li>

</ol>

<p>This approach is much more complex than using the local hard drive.
Here are some of the tradeoffs of this approach:</p>

<table style="margin-left:20px; border-spacing:5px 10px; 
              border-collapse:separate">

<tr valign="top"><td><b>PRO:</b></td>
<td>Your personal data can be accessed from more than one computer.
You can collect data from various computers throughout the day (but
note that the dashboard can still only be running on one computer at a
time).</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>PRO:</b></td>
<td>If the network server is managed by your IT department, and they
are performing periodic backups, your data will be protected from loss
in the case of a local hard drive crash.  (But make sure to verify
this with your IT department; if they aren't performing backups your
data still isn't protected.)</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>CON:</b></td>
<td>You can only access your personal data when your computer is
connected to the same network as the network file server.  It will be
inaccessible if you don't have a network connection, or if you're
traveling and don't have access to a VPN.</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>CON:</b></td>
<td>File sharing protocols often have very slow performance -
especially over a VPN.  The dashboard stores data in a large number of
fine-grained files, so if your network is slow, it can take an
exceptionally long time for the personal dashboard to open or shut
down.</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>CON:</b></td>
<td>The network folder must be mapped/mounted on all the computers you
use. These connections can time out and may need to be reestablished
manually (especially after changes in network connectivity).</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>CON:</b></td>
<td>File permissions can be tricky to configure.  The files you write
from one of your computers must be readable/writable by the other
computers you use.  And for data privacy, you'll need to make sure the
permissions forbid read/write access by other people.</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>CON:</b></td>
<td>If you use a mix of Windows, Mac OS X, and/or Linux computers, you
may encounter insurmountable problems stemming from their differing
support for file-sharing protocols.  (This could manifest itself as a
startup error stating that the dashboard was unable to lock files for
writing.)</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>CON:</b></td>
<td>Network file servers are a 1990's style technology that many IT
departments are reluctant to support.  With the modern preference
toward zero-trust architectures, many organizations are eliminating
their network file servers completely.</td></tr>

<h2><a name="cloud"></a>Cloud Storage</h2>

<p>Many cloud storage providers - such as OneDrive, Dropbox, Google
Drive, and others - offer desktop sync clients you can install on your
computer.  These sync clients copy files from your computer to the
cloud, and vice versa.  They generally work by creating a dedicated
folder on your computer's hard drive, then keeping the contents of
that special folder synchronized with the cloud.</p>

<p>This functionality provides an easy way to automatically backup
your personal data.  The general steps are:</p>

<ol>

<li>Create an account with a cloud storage provider, if you don't
already have one.  (If you already have a Microsoft 365 or Google
account, it comes with cloud storage included.  If you don't have one,
it's easy to create a free account.)</li>

<li>Download and install the desktop sync client offered by your cloud
storage provider.  Configure the sync client to start automatically
each time you log in to your computer.</li>

<li>Find the dedicated folder that your sync client is managing.
Create a new, empty directory somewhere under that folder for your
personal data.</li>

<li>When installing the dashboard, enter the path to that new, empty
directory as the location of your personal data.</li>

</ol>

<p>This approach is fairly simple to set up (especially if you've
already been using cloud storage).  Here are some of the benefits of
this approach:</p>

<table style="margin-left:20px; border-spacing:5px 10px; 
              border-collapse:separate">

<tr valign="top"><td><b>PRO:</b></td>
<td>Your personal data is protected from loss if your hard drive were
to crash.  The dashboard is writing your personal data into the
directory you've chosen, and the sync client is keeping it backed up
to the cloud automatically. (But this protection only happens if you
keep your sync client running in the background.  It the sync client
pauses, shuts down, loses its connection, or needs you to log in
again, your data won't be protected.)</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>PRO:</b></td>
<td>Your personal data is always accessible on this computer.  The
sync client keeps a copy of the files locally, so you can open your
personal dashboard and collect data at any time, even if you have no
network connection. (Note: some sync clients may have an option to
move files to the cloud to save space on your hard drive, then
download them on-the-fly they are needed.  This option isn't
recommended for the directory containing your personal data, because
it will result in extremely slow performance.)</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>PRO:</b></td>
<td>The major cloud storage providers offer robust, zero-trust
architectures to protect your data from unauthorized access.</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>CON:</b></td>
<td>Special steps are required to protect your data if it is being
synchronized to more than one computer. See the section below for more
information.</td></tr>

<h3><a name="cloudMult"></a>Using Cloud Storage to Access Personal
Data from Multiple Computers</h3>

<p>Cloud storage providers allow you to synchronize your files to more
than one computer, if you install their desktop sync client on all
computers in question.  This approach makes it possible to access your
personal data from multiple computers.  (But special precautions are
needed; see below.) The setup steps are:</p>

<ol>

<li>Set up a personal dashboard on cloud storage, using the steps
<a href="#cloud">described above</a>.</li>

<li>Install the desktop sync client on a second computer.  Configure
the sync client to use the same cloud storage account as the first
computer, and to run each time you log in.</li>

<li>Wait for the sync client to copy all files down from the cloud to
this second computer.  Find the directory containing your personal
data; it will include files like <tt>state</tt>, <tt>pspdash.ini</tt>,
and <tt>global.dat</tt>.</li>

<li>Install the Process Dashboard on this second computer.  When it
asks for the location of your personal data, provide the path to the
directory you found in the previous step.</li>

<li>Repeat steps 2-4 for other computers as desired.</li>

</ol>

<table>
<tr valign="top" style="font-weight: bold">
<td><img src="../../Images/alertWarning.png"></td>
<td style="color:#aa0000">IMPORTANT:&nbsp;</td>
<td>You must use extreme caution when using this technique.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>When the personal Process Dashboard is running, it expects to have
exclusive control over the files in your data directory.  (It does not
expect those files to be changed by any other program, including the
sync client.)  To ensure this exclusive control, it locks a file in
your data directory on startup, and releases the lock on shutdown.
Unfortunately, that lock doesn't work across the cloud storage
boundary.  As a result, the dashboard can't stop you from opening your
personal data on two computers at once.</p>

<p><b>If you open your personal Process Dashboard on two computers at
once, <span style="color:#aa0000">your data is almost certain to be
corrupted.</span></b>  The dashboards on each computer will be writing
files, each thinking they have exclusive control over the data.  One
is likely to blindly overwrite changes written by the other.  Even
worse, if a file is modified in both places at about the same time,
the sync client will flag a conflict and create multiple copies of the
conflicting file.  The dashboard cannot resolve those conflicts (and
neither can you).</p>

<p>To avoid these problems, you must faithfully follow the steps below
each time you want to change computers where the dashboard is
running:</p>

<ol>

<li>Close the Process Dashboard on the first computer.  Wait for all
windows to close.</li>

<li>Ensure the sync client on the first computer is active, and wait
for it to publish all files to the cloud.</li>

<li>Go to the computer where you'd like to run the Process Dashboard
next.  Ensure its sync client is active.  Wait for it to copy all
files down from the cloud.<ul>

    <li>Note that sync operations typically happen in the background
        with low priority, and there often isn't an explicit way to
        force a sync to occur.</li>

    <li>Your sync client may claim that all files are up-to-date, even
        when new files are waiting in the cloud.  Waiting 5 minutes or
        so is a good precaution.</li>

    <li>If you cannot wait, take a look at the <tt>log.txt</tt> file
        in your data directory.  If its timestamp reflects the time
        you closed the dashboard on the first computer, and your sync
        client says files are up-to-date, you're safe to proceed.</li>

    </ul></li>

<li>Open the Process Dashboard on the second computer.  Do a quick
review to make sure data is as you expect (correct task selected,
recent time log entries in place, etc.)</li>

</ol>

<p>If you only move between computers infrequently, you can follow
these instructions fairly easily by keeping your sync client actively
running everywhere, closing the Process Dashboard when you're not
using it, and being very deliberate about tracking the computer where
the dashboard is currently running.</p>

<p>If you're in the habit of moving between computers frequently, the
risk of accidentally corrupting your personal data will grow.  If
you're unable to follow the steps above faithfully, you should
consider limiting your dashboard usage to a single computer, or moving
your data to an Enterprise Server as <a href="#pdes">described
below</a>.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The precautions in this section only apply to the
personal Process Dashboard, not to the Team Dashboard.  The Team
Dashboard can be configured to support cloud-based usage from multiple
computers simultaneously.</p>



<h2><a name="pdes"></a>Process Dashboard Enterprise Server</h2>

<p>The Process Dashboard Enterprise Server was purpose-designed to
provide specialized storage for team and personal data.  It is
optimized for fast, reliable access, and eliminates many of the
challenges described above.  The general steps for using the
Enterprise Server are:</p>

<ol>

<li>Obtain an account on a Process Dashboard Enterprise Server.

    <ul>

    <li>If many people in your organization use the Process Dashboard,
        your organization can <a target="_blank"
        href="https://www.processdash.com/pdes-pricing/">purchase a
        license</a> to run the server in-house.</li>

    <li>For personal use, or use by a small team, <a target="_blank"
        href="https://www.processdash.com/pdes-pricing/">monthly
        subscriptions</a> are available.</li>

    </ul></li>

<li>Log in to the Enterprise Server in your web browser.  After
successfully logging in, the main home page is the "My Datasets"
view.</li>

<li>Click the "Process Dashboard" link on the "My Datasets" page.
This will download a small file with instructions to launch your
personal dashboard.

    <ul>

    <li>Some web browsers will open this file automatically; if your
        browser does not, double-click the file to open it
        manually.</li>

    <li>If your computer doesn't know how to open the file, click the
        link at the bottom of the "My Datasets" page to download and
        install the Process Dashboard Launcher software.</li>

    </ul></li>

<li>Your server-based personal dashboard will open.

    <ul>

    <li>If you don't have any data in the server yet, the dashboard
        will look for preexisting personal data on your computer, and
        offer to import it into the server.</li>

    </ul></li>

<li>You can open your server-based personal dashboard from as many
other computers as you like.  Just log in to the Enterprise Server
through your web browser and click the "Process Dashboard" link on the
"My Datasets" page.  If you've installed the Process Dashboard
Launcher, you can also use its application icon to open your
dashboard.</li>

</ol>

<p>The Enterprise Server provides a number of benefits:</p>

<table style="margin-left:20px; border-spacing:5px 10px; 
              border-collapse:separate">

<tr valign="top"><td><b>PRO:</b></td>
<td>Your data is safely backed up to the server at all times, and
won't be lost if your hard drive crashes.</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>PRO:</b></td>
<td>You can access your data from any number of different computers
(including a mix of Windows / Mac OS X / Linux computers) without
worrying about locks or corruption.  It is still only possible to have
the dashboard open on one computer at a time, but the server enforces
that constraint reliably.</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>PRO:</b></td>
<td>Dashboard operations are not affected by the speed of your
network.  Startup and shutdown times remain consistent, even over a
slow VPN.</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>PRO:</b></td>
<td>If you need to let a coach or team leader access your data, you
can grant them permissions.</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>PRO:</b></td>
<td>You don't need to manually upgrade the Dashboard when new versions
of the software become available. The server administrator can push
software upgrades automatically.</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>PRO:</b></td>
<td>A "time machine" feature makes it possible to see what your data
looked like at an arbitrary time in the past.  This can assist with
postmortem analysis, data recovery, and more.</td></tr>

<h2><a name="changing"></a>Changing the Location of Personal Data</h2>

<p>To change your data directory between the various file-based
location types (local / network / cloud), follow these steps:</p>

<ol>

<li>Close the dashboard if it is running.</li>

<li>Manually move your data directory to the new location, using an
application like File Explorer / Finder / etc.</li>

<li>Run the Process Dashboard installer again.  When it asks you for
the location of your personal data, enter the path to the new
directory location.  Then finish the remaining steps in the installer,
and let it recreate your shortcuts.  This will update your shortcuts
to point to the new location.</li>

<li>Use your shortcut to open the dashboard, and make sure your data
is present as expected.

    <ul>

    <li>If the dashboard is completely empty, don't panic. This
        doesn't mean your data is lost; it just means your shortcut
        isn't pointing to the correct data directory.</li>

    <li>Check the location the dashboard is using by choosing "&equiv;
        &rarr; Help &rarr; About Process Dashboard," then clicking on
        the Configuration tab.  Make sure it shows the expected new
        location.  If it's still using the old location, the shortcut
        you're using didn't get updated by the installer.</li>

    <li>If the dashboard is using the wrong location, close it and run
        the installer again to fix the shortcut.  If this doesn't
        help, you can fix the shortcut manually by following
        <a href="../Troubleshooting/FAQ.html#WhereData">these
        instructions</a> in the FAQ.</li>

    </ul></li>

</ol>

<p>If you wish to move your personal data into the Enterprise Server,
just use the computer that is currently hosting your data to open your
server-based dataset for the first time.  The dashboard will see that
your server-based dataset is empty, will notice the existing data on
your computer, and will offer to migrate the data in
automatically.</p>
