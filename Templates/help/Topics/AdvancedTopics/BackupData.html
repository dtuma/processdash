<h1>Backing up Dashboard Data</h1>

<p>The metrics data you collect is very valuable information.  Accordingly,
the dashboard provides several mechanisms for backing up this
information.</p>

<h2><a name="manual"></a>Manual Data Backups</h2>

<p>At any time, you can manually save a backup of your data by choosing
&quot;<img src="../../Images/cmenu.png">&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Tools&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Save Data Backup&quot;.
This will prompt you for the name of a ZIP file, and will save a full
backup of your data to the given file.</p>

<p>Optionally, you can choose to save your data as a &quot;Process
Dashboard Backup&quot; file.  This format contains the exact same data
as the ZIP file, but may be useful in organizations that forbid the
attachment of ZIP files to email messages.</p>

<p>Finally, you can choose to save your data as a &quot;Redacted Process
Dashboard Backup&quot; file.  This format allows you to select various
categories of information that should be scrambled or removed from the data
backup.  This format can be useful if you need to protect the privacy of
individuals or if you need to obscure proprietary information.  However, some
types of data cannot be redacted; so if the original data is highly sensitive,
you should still use caution and review the resulting backup carefully before
releasing it.</p>


<h3><a name="ViewBackup"></a>Viewing the data in a manual data backup</h3>

<p>To view the data in a data backup, choose 
&quot;<img src="../../Images/cmenu.png">&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Tools&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Open
Dataset&quot;, and a file
chooser window will open.  Choose a data backup file in ZIP or PDBK format,
and a second Process Dashboard window will open, displaying the data from
that file.  The data you view in that second window is transient/temporary
data extracted from the backup; any changes you make will be discarded when
the window is closed.</p>

<p>In addition, the Process Dashboard "Tools for Team Leaders" include a
program called the Quick Launcher.  You can drag a data backup file onto the
Quick Launcher, and it will open a Process Dashboard window displaying the
data inside.  This functionality works just like the Open Dataset option on
the Tools menu, but does not require another Process Dashboard window to be
open first.</p>

<h3>Restoring data from manual data backups</h3>

<p>A data backup is just a ZIP file, containing the data in your personal
data directory (along with some additional information).  If you have lost
or corrupted your personal data and you wish to restore your data from a
backup, take these steps:</p>

<ol>

<li><a name="RestoreSteps">Shut down the dashboard</a>.  <b>It is
    imperative that the dashboard NOT be running</b> while you perform the
    steps below.</li>

<li>Extract the contents of your data backup file into your personal
    <a href="../Troubleshooting/FAQ.html#WhereData">data directory</a>,
    overwriting the files that are there.</li>

<li>Restart the Process Dashboard.</li>

</ol>

<h2><a name="automatic"></a>Automatic, External Backups</h2>

<p>The mechanism described above is very useful for interpersonal
communication.  But for disaster recovery, it is important to have an
automated backup strategy.  If your computer and hard drive were to crash,
you wouldn't want to discover that your most recent backup was several
weeks old.</p>

<p>Thus, the dashboard has a mechanism for making backups on a regular
basis.  To configure an automatic backup, take these steps:</p>

<ol>

<li>Click on the <img src="../../Images/cmenu.png"> menu and choose 
    &quot;Tools&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Preferences.&quot;</li>

<li>In the User Preferences dialog, select the &quot;Backups&quot;
    category.  A table will be displayed, showing a list of external
    locations where backups should be saved.</li>

<li>Click the "Add" button to add a new backup location. Specify the
    full name of a backup ZIP file where you would like data to be
    saved, then click OK.</li>

</ol>

<p>Each time the dashboard is shut down, it will create a backup ZIP file
and save it to the location you've requested.  If you are in the habit of
leaving the dashboard running overnight, it will also save this backup each
evening between midnight and 1 AM.  The backup ZIP file will be overwritten
each time, so at any point in time the external backup file will contain a
copy of your most recent data.</p>

<p>If you want to keep a history of backup files, include the
word<tt> %date </tt>in the name of your backup file. (Make certain to type
this exactly as written: a percent sign followed by the word "date" in all
lower case.) The current date (YYYY-MM-DD) will be included in the name of
the file, so backups from dates in the past will not be overwritten.  This
can be particularly useful for the Team Dashboard, as a way to maintain a
record of how the team plan has changed over time.  If you use this
technique, keep in mind that no old backups will be discarded, so the list
of backup files could grow very large over time.  You may need to visit the
directory periodically and purge old backups that are no longer needed.</p>

<p>The backups created by this process are identical to the backups created
by the manual "Save Data Backup" operation. Thus, they can be viewed in the
Quick Launcher, and the mechanism for restoring from a backup is the
same.</p>

<h3>Additional Uses</h3>

<p>Many teams choose to use backup files for a secondary purpose.
Specifically, a process coach, team leader, or PSP instructor may need to
look at the data for a particular individual, so they can troubleshoot data
entry problems or mentor the individual in their process improvement
efforts.  The automatic external backups and manual data backups provide a
simple way to support this particular need.</p>

<p>Accordingly, your team may decide to agree upon a particular network
directory, then have each individual save an automatic backup to that
directory.  This would provide a disaster recovery plan if a team member's
computer were to crash.  In addition, it could enable your coach or
planning manager to examine data for a particular individual if
necessary.</p>

<p>If you choose to follow this approach, consideration should be given to
data privacy concerns.  For example, you might consider configuring the
permissions on the given network directory to prevent read access by
arbitrary individuals.  On the other hand, if your organization follows
high-maturity practices and does not abuse personal data for inappropriate
purposes, this may not be a significant concern.  Each organization must
make these decisions based on their organizational climate.  If
organizational data privacy concerns outweigh the benefits of information
sharing, you may wish to lock down the permissions so that data backups can
only be read by the individual who created them.</p>



<h2>Automatic, Internal Backups</h2>

<p>The mechanisms above can be very useful for disaster recovery, such as
the loss of your hard drive.  But occasionally you may encounter other
problems.  For example, you might accidentally delete a large portion of
your task hierarchy.  Or you might encounter a rare bug in the Process
Dashboard that corrupts your data.  In these cases, by the time you shut
down the Process Dashboard, your external backup would already be
overwritten with the problem data.</p>

<p>To address these types of problems, the Process Dashboard automatically
maintains a set of internal backups that reflect changes made to your data
over the past few weeks.  Each time the dashboard starts up or shuts down,
and at least once daily, the dashboard will zip up the files containing
your data.  This ZIP file is stored in a "backup" subdirectory underneath
your <a href="../Troubleshooting/FAQ.html#WhereData">data
directory</a>.</p>

<p>If you look in this "backup" directory, you will typically notice many
ZIP files.  The most recent file is a <b>full</b> backup of your data,
similar to a manual data backup.  Earlier files are not full backups - they
are incremental backups, containing only the files that changed between two
points in time.</p>

<p>Incremental backups are not preserved forever.  By default, the dashboard
will retain backups for three weeks.  (This timeframe can be changed via the
<a href="PreferencesTool.html">preferences editor</a>.)</p>


<h3>Restoring data from automatic, periodic backups</h3>

<p>If you decided that your data had been corrupted in some way, and you
wanted to restore your data to some earlier point in time, you would follow
the steps below.  (Make certain you understand these instructions
completely before you begin, and <b>use extreme caution</b> when following
them; incorrect actions could result in permanent data corruption!
<b>Proceed at your own risk.</b>)</p>

<ol>

<li><a name="RestoreSteps">Shut down the dashboard</a>.  <b>It is
    imperative that the dashboard NOT be running</b> while you perform the
    steps below.</li>

<li>View the contents of your "backup" directory, and sort the files so
    they appear in chronological order.  The names assigned to the files
    are designed to help you perform this sort correctly.</li>

<li>Use a ZIP extraction tool to extract the contents of the most recent
    ZIP file, placing the files into your data directory.  This will
    overwrite files that are already present in that directory.</li>

<li>Next, extract the second-to-last ZIP file, also placing the results
    into your data directory, and overwriting files.  Continue in this
    manner, working your way backward through the ZIP files, until you
    reach the file representing the moment in time you wish to restore
    to.</li>

<li>At this point, you may restart the dashboard.  It should reflect the
    newly restored data, but please note the following:</li>

    <ul>

    <li>Any data that was collected after your selected &quot;restore
        point&quot; will no longer be present in your dashboard.  (After
        all, you've just intentionally restored the data to that earlier
        point in time.)</li>

    <li>The very act of starting the dashboard will cause it to create a
        new incremental backup file, capturing the changes you made in
        steps 3-4 above.  Thus, if you realize that you did not restore to
        the correct instant in time, you will need to start again at <a
        href="#RestoreSteps">Step 1</a>, shutting down the dashboard,
        sorting the new list of backup files, and reextracting all of the
        incremental backups in order.</li>

    </ul>

</ol>
