<P>By default, the dashboard maintains one set of To Date data, which rolls 
up data from all of your completed PSP projects. This may not meet your data 
needs. For example, if you continually work in several different programming 
languages, you might want multiple, independent sets of To Date data, one 
for each programming language.  "Data Rollup Templates" address this need.</P>

<p>Data Rollup Templates allow filtering of the data that appears on process 
forms such as the Project Plan Summary.  Once you have created a data rollup 
in your hierarchy, you can choose to view the forms based on all of your PSP 
related data or just on the subset that you have defined.  The Data Rollup 
Templates can also be used to rollup data from many small PSP-sized tasks up 
to the project level. It's just a matter of how you define the data rollup 
filter expression.</P>

<H2>Creating Multiple "To Date" Data Sets</H2>

<p>Extra To Date data sets are created using the
<a href="../Planning/UsingHierarchyEditor.html">Hierarchy Editor</a>.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/HierarchyEditorRollup.png"></p>

<p>You can rename the data set node just like you can a project.  Also, the 
location of the data set itself in the hierarchy is not important.  Just 
place it wherever it seems to fit best to you.  For more information on 
adding nodes and templates and on using the hierarchy editor in general, see 
the <a href="../Planning/UsingHierarchyEditor.html">hierarchy editor</a> help 
topic.</p>

<p>Note - there is always a default rollup, defined automatically by the 
dashboard, which is called "/To Date/PSP/All".  This rollup will not appear 
in your hierarchy, but its data is available for use by projects in your 
hierarchy.</p>

<a name="filter"></a><H2>Customizing "To Date" Data Sets</H2>

<p>When you first create a new To Date data set, it will (by default) be 
rolling up data from all completed PSP projects.  Therefore, the first thing 
you'll probably want to do is customize the filter which is used to generate 
the list of projects that it will roll up data from.  This is done via data 
entered in an HTML form, much like the standard process forms.</p>

<p>To access the filtering form, use the task selector to navigate to the To
Date data set you have just created.  Once there, click the script button and
choose "Edit Data Rollup Filter."</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/ChooseEditDataRollupFilter.png"></p>

<p>The filter form will appear that will let you edit the expression that is 
used to filter the project list that is used in the data rollup.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/DataRollupFilterForm.png"></p>

<p>Some common filtering criteria are displayed as choices on the form:
<ul>
 <li>Only rollup projects completed after a certain date</li>
 <li>Only rollup projects written with a certain language</li>
 <li>Only rollup projects with certain keywords</li>
 <li>Only rollup projects whose hierarchy path starts with a certain 
   string</li>
</ul>

<p>You can check the appropriate boxes, and edit the details for each 
criteria.  When you're done, click the "Filter!" button. This button will 
compute the corresponding filter expression, and put it in the box below.  
This will also cause the "list of included projects" to recalculate, showing 
you all the projects in your hierarchy that meet the criteria.</p>

<p>If you feel comfortable with the data expression syntax, you can edit the 
filter expression directly.  After you make changes to the expression, you'll 
have to move the cursor out of the text area (by hitting TAB or by clicking 
somewhere on the HTML page background) for the included project list to 
recalculate.</p>

<p><B>TIP:</B> If the included project list is empty and you don't think it 
should be, you may have a syntax error in your filter expression.  A syntax 
error in your expression will essentially be treated the same as the 
expression "false".  Note, however, that an empty included project list does 
not automatically mean your filter expression syntax is bad - it may be a 
valid expression, and there just might not be any projects that meet the 
criteria.</p>
    
<H2>Viewing Rolled Up Data</H2>    

<P>To view rolled up data, use the active task selector to navigate to a data
rollup node, then click the script button and choose the first option. The
<A HREF="../PostmortemAnalysis/DataChartsAndReports.html#charts">Data
Analysis</A> center will appear - but it will be displaying only data from the
projects that you have included in your rollup!  In fact, the main "PSP Data
Analysis" center which is launched from the configuration menu is nothing more
than a view of the rolled up data for the automatic data rollup called "/To
Date/PSP/All".</P>

<H2>Using Alternate "To Date" Data Sets</H2>

<p>Once you have created an additional data rollup set, you will notice that 
all of your PSP Project Plan Summaries will contain an extra drop-down list.  
This drop down list is located in the "Project Settings" section of the plan 
summary form.  The drop-down list is labeled "Base 'To Date' PSP data on:", 
and the drop down list will contain all the PSP data rollup objects you have 
defined, plus the extra "default" rollup, which is called "/To 
Date/PSP/All".  Choosing a different rollup from this list will cause this 
project to use that rollup as the basis for data in the "Plan" and "To Date" 
columns.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/DataRollupSummaryPullDown.png"></p>

<p><B>TIP:</B> remember that data in the plan column <A 
HREF="../Planning/EnteringData.html#dataFreezing">freezes</A> when planning is marked
complete, and data in the "To Date" columns freezes when the project is 
marked complete.  Therefore, if Planning and/or the entire project is marked 
complete when you alter the drop-down, the data in the "Plan" and/or "To 
Date" columns will not recalculate.</p>
