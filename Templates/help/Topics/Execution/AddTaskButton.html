<h1>Using the Add Task Button</h1>

<p>When you are working on a project, sophisticated tools like the 
<a href="../../../teamhelp/Topics/EditingTheWBS.html">Work Breakdown Structure
Editor</a> and the <a href="../Planning/UsingHierarchyEditor.html">Hierarchy
Editor</a> are provided to create, edit, and reorganize tasks.  But sometimes,
you just need to create a single new task, and it's more convenient to do this
without leaving the main dashboard toolbar. The Add Task button is provided
for this purpose.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/MainWindowAddTaskButton.png"></p>

<p>Clicking this button will allow you to create a new task in the dashboard.
The window that appears will show you where the new task will be created, and
will allow you to enter a task name.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/AddTaskDialog.png"></p>

<p>The new task will be created under the named parent, and will immediately
follow the currently selected task.</p>

<p>In most cases, this means that the new task will appear in the hierarchy
immediately after the task that was selected when you clicked the button.  But
if the previously selected task belongs to a rigidly structured process (such
as the PSP), it may not be possible to insert your new task inside.  In that
case, the new task will immediately follow the rigidly structured task.  (In
the screen shots above, Component B was a PSP task, so the new task will be
created in "Release 1" immediately following Component B.)</p>

<p>When you add a task to a team project, you can also choose the process
phase that the new task should belong to.  By default, the new task will have
the same phase type as the task you were previously working on.  But you can
click the node icon to select a different task type.</p>

<p>After you create a new task, it's a good idea to estimate the time it will
require.  You can do this by clicking the <a href="PercentSpent.html">Percent
Spent Indicator</a>.</p>

<p>For now, the Add Task button does not provide any functionality for editing
or deleting tasks. If you add a task by accident, or if you mistype the name
of the new task, you will need to fix the mistake using either:<ul>

<li>the <a href="../../../teamhelp/Topics/EditingTheWBS.html">WBS Editor</a>,
if you added the new task to a
<a href="../Planning/CreatingProjects.html">team or personal project</a>, or</li>

<li>the <a href="../Planning/UsingHierarchyEditor.html">Hierarchy Editor</a>,
if the new task is not part of any project.</li>

</ul></p>
