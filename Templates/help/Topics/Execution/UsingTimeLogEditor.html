<H1>Using the Time Log Editor</H1>

<P>You can use the time log editor to correct mistakes you might make when
timing your activities.  The time log editor can be opened by selecting the
"Time Log" option on the <a href="ConfigureMenu.html">configuration
menu</a>.</P>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/TimeLogEditor.png"></p>

<h2>Project hierarchy</h2>
<P>The left pane shows the current project hierarchy.  Selecting various 
branches on the hierarchy will limit the time entries displayed to just those 
on the branch chosen.</P>

<P>Next to the name of each hierarchy node, the dashboard displays the total
amount of time that has been logged against that node and all its children.
If you apply a date filter (see below), these times will recalculate based on
the filtered view of the time log.  You can use the "Time Format" pulldown
control to display these times in hours:minutes, decimal hours, or percentages
(of either the total time, or the time logged to the parent of the node).</P>

<a name="dateFilter"></a><h2>Date filter</h2>
<P>Above the split pane is a set of controls that provide date filtering on 
the time entries display.  Once the desired span of dates has been chosen, 
clicking the "Apply Filter" button will restrict the data shown to the range 
of dates specified.</p>

<P>The Apply Filter button has a pulldown control that provides for several 
common date filters.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/ShowTimeLogFilterPullDown.png"></p>

<P>To the left of the "From" entry box and the right of the "To" entry box 
are double arrowed buttons.  These buttons will jump the date filtering 
forward and backward by a unit of time equal to the current filtering date 
range.  For example, if you have filtered the data in the Time Log such that 
only one week of data is showing, pressing these buttons will cause the 
filtering to move backward or forward by one week at a time.</p>

<P>In addition, you can enter dates directly in the "From" and "To" boxes
to perform a customized date range.</P>

<h2>Time entries</h2>
<P>To change data in the time entries, just pick on the element that you would
like to change.  The elements in the time entries pane are editable.</P>

<P>The "Logged To" column shows the project, task, and process phase to which
the time was logged.  If you select one or more table rows, you can drag them
onto a different leaf of the tree to move them to a different task.  (This is
helpful if you logged time against the wrong task by mistake.)  You can also
move entries by highlighting rows, pressing Ctrl-X, highlighting a new task,
and pressing Ctrl-V.</P>

<P>The remaining columns display editable data for each time log entry.  The
"Start Time" column shows the start date/time for the activity.  The "Delta"
column shows the length of time spent in the activity.  The "Int" column shows
the amount of time that the given activity was interrupted.  The "Comment"
column allows you to enter a comment for a particular time log entry.</P>

<h2>Control buttons</h2>
<P>The Add and Delete buttons allow the addition and deletion of time 
entries.  When Add is chosen, by default the last entry in the time log will 
be copied into a new log entry.  You can choose which entry will be copied to 
make the new time entry by picking one of the entries before clicking the Add 
button, or by highlighting the corresponding leaf of the tree.</P>

<P>The Save and Revert buttons will save the changes or revert the entries to 
their previous values.</P>

<a name="summarize"></a><P>The Summarize button will collapse all time 
entries that were logged to the same process phase into one entry.  The 
Dashboard will create new entries each time that it starts recording time in 
a given process phase (i.e. when a process phase is left and then returned to 
again for more time measurement).  This function will allow you to collaspe 
all duplicates entries in the current display.</P>

<a name="TimeCardView"></a><p>The Time Card View button will display another 
view of the time data.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/TimeCardView.png"></p>

<p>The Time Card View is handy if you work for an employer that makes you 
submit time cards or time sheets.  You can open this window and refer to
the data it contains as you enter data into your employer's time card.</p>

<p>At the top left, a pulldown and a text field allow you to choose the
month and year to display.  On the left side of the window is an
abbreviated version of your hierarchy, containing only the nodes and tasks
where you logged time during the selected month.  Columns are displayed for
the days in the month.  Tooltips on the column headers display the
corresponding day of the week, and the columns for Saturday and Sunday appear
with a slightly different background color.  Cells in the table display the
amount of time logged by day and by task.</p>

<p>Two controls in the top center of the window allow you to customize the
display.  You can hide columns for days that contain no time data using the
checkbox, and you can change the display time format using the pulldown.</p>

<p>You can choose to display time in hours:minutes, decimal hours, or
minutes.</p>
