<p>When you are using a high-maturity process to do work, that process will
commonly provide scripts, forms, reports, and other tools to assist you.  To
see these items, click the script button on the dashboard.</P>

<P align="center"><IMG SRC="../../Images/PointToScriptButton.png"></P>

<P><A NAME="pullDown"></A>Clicking the script button will open a menu showing
the scripts, forms, reports, and other materials that have been provided by
the process for the currently active task.</P>

<P align="center"><IMG SRC="../../Images/ScriptButtonShowMenu.png"></P>

<P>Choosing an item from this menu will open the named script or form in your
web browser.</p>

<P align="center"><IMG SRC="../../Images/PSP21PlanningScript.png"></P>

<P>This example shows a project calling up the Planning script for PSP2.1.</P>

<P><a name="clickOpensDefault"></a>Clicking the script button normally opens
the menu of scripts and forms.  If you prefer, you can reconfigure the script
button so that it automatically opens the default script or form.  Just check
the appropriate box in the <a href="../AdvancedTopics/PreferencesTool.html">Preferences
Tool</a>.  After enabling that option, you can use the drop-down button to
open the full menu.</P>

<P><a name="scriptBrowser"></a>You can also select the &quot;More...&quot;
option at the bottom of the menu to bring up a script browser. The
script browser shows your hierarchy on the left; when you highlight a
node in the hierarchy, it displays the available scripts and forms on
the right. You can open one of those scripts or forms by
double-clicking on it.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../../Images/ScriptBrowser.png"></p>

<P>The script browser makes it easy to pull up forms for historical projects
without needing to change the active task.</p>

<h2>Custom Hyperlinks</h2>

<p>In addition to the scripts and forms that come with the dashboard, you
may have other web pages that are related to the task at hand.  For example:</p>

<ul>

<li>Your team may have a wiki page, sharepoint site, or other
    collaboration area for items relating to your project</li>

<li>The requirements for a component may be accessible at a particular
    webpage</li>

<li>Your team may have a wiki page where you are discussing the design
    of a component</li>

<li>You may have a link to a page in a defect tracking system describing
    a set of changes that need to be made</li>

<li>A team code inspection may be capturing feedback with a Git pull request
or other online code review tool</li>

</ul>

<p>You can easily attach URLs such as these to the projects and tasks in the
dashboard.  Just select the "Add New Link..." option near the bottom of the
menu.  Then enter the name and target of the link, and decide which project,
component, or task the link is associated with:</p>

<P align="center"><img src="../../Images/ScriptMenuAddCustomLink.png"></p>

<p>Your custom link will appear in the menu whenever you are working on the
selected project, component, or task:</p>

<P align="center"><img src="../../Images/ScriptPullDownWithCustomLink.png"></p>

<p>You can alter or delete custom links by clicking the "edit" icon that
appears on the right edge of the menu item.</p>

<p>When you create custom links, they are recorded in the note for the
selected component or task.  If that component/task is part of a team project,
the link will be shared with your team members too.  For more information on
this feature, see the <a href="NoteIndicator.html#embedURL">note editor</a>
help topic.</p>


<h2>The timing icons</h2><P>Many of the built-in process 
scripts contain little stopwatch icons on them.  These icons provide another 
way to navigate and time a process phase.  When you click on one of these 
icons, the current phase being measured will change to the phase indicated by 
the icon and the timer will start measuring time for that phase.</p>

<H2>External documents</H2>

<P>Creating or obtaining documents is often an integral part of performing
a process. The dashboard process scripts sometimes provide hyperlinks for
these documents. If you click on a document hyperlink, the dashboard will:</p>

<OL>
  <LI>Possibly ask you for pertinent information. For example, the
    dashboard may need to know the name of a directory where it should
    store documents     for this project, and it may display a form
    requesting that information. Once you provide this information and
    click &quot;OK,&quot; the dashboard generally won't have to ask for it
    again.</LI>
  <LI>Check to see if the file already exists. If not, it may be able to
    create the file from a template.</LI>
  <LI>Open the file for editing.</LI>
</OL>

<h2>Entering data into the forms</h2>

<P>The various forms necessary to do your work have data entry fields which 
are to be used to capture the various process metrics.  The forms are 
continually "live", which means they are always ready and waiting for input.  
There is no "submit" or "send" button on the forms.  Just enter the data in 
the blanks and the dashboard will record it. Some blanks on the forms are greyed out.  These data elements are computed 
by the dashboard and do not require data input. For more information, see
the <A HREF="../Planning/EnteringData.html">Entering data</A> help topic.</P>
