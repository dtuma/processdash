<H1>Selecting the Active Task</H1>

<p>As you work, the dashboard maintains a concept of the currently active
task.  This task is displayed in the middle of the Process Dashboard toolbar.
Items such as the play/pause button, the defect button, the script button and
the completion checkbox always operate against this active task.  The image
below shows the dashboard ready to work on the Code phase of "Component A,"
which is part of "Release 1" in "My Project".</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/ShowHierarchyMenus.png"></p>

<p>You can click on the name of the active task to change it.  You can also
click on the "overflow menu" to the left of the task name for more options.
For convenience, this overflow menu provides two different "task selection
styles" you can use.  To move betweeen tasks in 
<a href="#taskListNav">chronological order</a>, click on the "Task Lists"
option.  To select tasks <a href="#hierNav">hierarchically</a> (the default),
click on the "All Tasks" option.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/TaskNavigationStyleSelector.png"></p>

<h2><a name="hierNav"></a>Selecting Tasks Hierarchically</h2>

<p>By default, the dashboard uses the hierarchical task selection style.  To
better illustrate how this style works, the following example set of projects
will be used.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/TaskNavigationHierarchyEditor.png"></p>


<P>This project hierarchy shows two top level project categories: "Project"
and "Non Project".  These are the two categories given as default when the
dashboard is first run.  Under "Project" there are four items defined: "My
Project", "Web Project", "SOA Project", and "Legacy".  Under "My Project",
several items are defined, including "Release 1".  "Release 1" has four
subtasks, called "Component A" through "Component D".  In this screenshot,
only "Component A" has been expanded to show its phases.  Phases are added
into the project hierarchy as children of a project.  "Component A" was
created from a <a href="../Overview/ProcessScripts.html#psp">PSP2.1
template</a>, and so it has all the development phases of a PSP2.1
project.</P>

<P>Back on the dashboard itself, if you click on the first element in the
active task name, it will show all the entries in the project hierarchy that
are defined at that level.  In this case it shows the two default nodes
"Project" and "Non Project".</P>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/HierarchyMenus1.png"></p>

<P>Selecting the second name element shows the entries defined at that level
under the selection from the first menu.  In this case, the user has selected
"Project" on the first menu, so the second menu shows the children of
"Project" in the project hierarchy.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/HierarchyMenus2.png"></p>

<P>Clicking any task name element will display the hierarchical children of
the component or task to the left.  This final example shows the PSP 2.1
process phases that are defined for "Component A".</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/HierarchyMenus3.png"></p>

<p>To help you keep track which tasks have marked complete, the task selector
menus use a strikethrough font.  (In the image above, the "Planning,"
"Design," and "Design Review" tasks have been marked complete.)  You can mark
an item complete with the <a href="CompletionButton.html">completion
checkbox</a>.</p>

<p>If your work hierarchy is deep and complex, there may not be enough
horizontal space to display the full name of the active task.  In that case,
the dashboard will display as much of the task as will fit.  (If you would
like to see more of the task name, just resize the dashboard window to be
bigger.)</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/ShowHierarchyMenusTruncated.png"></p>

<p> If you hover over a truncated name, a tool tip will tell you the full
name.  You can click the overflow menu to display the name elements that were
dropped, and select different components at that level:</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/HierarchyMenus4.png"></p>

<p><a name="hiddenCompletedTasks"></a>As you accumulate more projects and more
tasks in your personal dashboard, the menu of choices under a particular item
can potentially grow very long.  To reduce clutter, the dashboard will identify
projects and tasks that you completed some time ago, and move them to a submenu
called "Older Completed Items."  (You can configure this behavior in the
<a href="../AdvancedTopics/PreferencesTool.html#hideCompletedTasks">Preferences
Editor</a>.)</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/ShowHierarchyMenusOlderCompleted.png"></p>


<h2><a name="taskListNav"></a>Selecting Tasks Chronologically from a Task List</h2>

<p>If you are actively working on a project, you may find that you spend most
of your time working on tasks that are in a particular earned value task list.
A special task selection style makes this easy.  Just click on the task
selection overflow menu and choose "Task Lists..."  A window will ask you for
the name of the task list for the project that you are working on.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/ChooseTaskNavigationList.png"></p>

<p>Select the task list that you are working on, and click OK.  (If you know
you will only be working on a subset of a particular task list, you can drill
down into the task list and select the portion you plan to work on.)  The
active task selector will now display a single menu which lists tasks in
chronological order (as defined in the
<a href="../Planning/TaskScheduleSteps.html#flatView">flat view</a> of the
earned value schedule).

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/TaskListNavigationMenu.png"></p>

<p>If you are splitting your time between several projects, you can still use
this approach to select tasks (across several projects) in roughly
chronological order.  Just 
<a href="../Planning/UsingTaskSchedule.html#createNew">create an EV rollup</a>
of the projects you are working on; then use this approach to navigate within
that task list.</p>

<p>For more information on creating earned value schedules, and using the
flat view of their task lists, see the
<a href="../Planning/TaskScheduleSteps.html">Creating a schedule step by
step</a> help topic.</p>


<h2>Selecting a Task Directly</h2>

<p>Often you may have a specific task in mind that you would like to work on.
Just click on the "Find Task" icon that appears to the right of the active
task name.  This will display a window of tasks (either from the hierarchy or
from the current task list, depending on the current task selection
style).</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/QuickSelectTaskWindow.png"></p>

<p>As you type in the "Find" box, the list of selections will automatically be
narrowed to show tasks containing all of the letters you've typed.
Capitalization is not important, and you can enter multiple filters separated
by spaces. In the example above, the user has typed "leg&nbsp;scr".  The first
filter "leg" has narrowed the tree to show tasks under the "Legacy" portion of
the hierarchy. The second filter "scr" has further narrowed the list to show
Tasks with the letters "scr" in the name.  (The end result is that
"leg&nbsp;scr" has narrowed the list to show tasks associated with legacy
software change requests.)  You can collapse branches of the tree that
correspond to old, inactive projects; collapsed branches will not match the
search filter.</p>

<p>You can press the up and down arrow keys to select a specific task, and
press the Enter key to change to the highlighted task.  In addition, you can
click directly on a task to activate it.</p>
