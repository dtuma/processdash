<H1>Using the Task Completion Checkbox</H1>

<P>As you complete the activities for a given task, you should mark
that task as completed via the completion checkbox.</P>

<p class="figure"><img src="../../Images/PointToCompletionButton.png"></p>

<p>Checking the box marks the task complete with the current date and time.
If you need to enter a different completion date, press and hold the Ctrl
button on your keyboard as you click the checkbox.</p>

<P>When you mark a task complete with this checkbox, the dashboard will
automatically change the currently active task to the next process step in the
current component.  (This behavior can be disabled with the
<a href="../AdvancedTopics/PreferencesTool.html#selectNext">Preferences
Editor</a>.)  If the timer is currently running, it will automatically stop
recording time for the given task and start the timing of the next task.  For
more information on using the timer, see the <a href="PlayPause.html">Using
the Play/Pause button</A> help topic.</P>

<P>Tasks marked as complete will show a little checkmark in the completion
checkbox.  (If you hover the mouse over the checked box, the tooltip will tell
you exactly what date and time the task was marked complete.)</P>

<P>If you need to go back to a previous phase in a given process, you can 
still do so even if the completion checkbox has been pressed. The dashboard 
will still accumulate time in whatever task you make current.  (It will
display a warning to make certain you're not logging time to the completed
task by mistake, but you can safely dismiss this dialog.)</P>

<h2 NO_NUMBER>Marking a <i>task</i> complete vs marking the <i>project</i>
complete</h2>

<p>By default, a PSP project will be considered complete when all the phases
in the project have been marked complete. However, if you manually edit the
project completion date on the plan summary form (either via the input field
or the checkbox), then you have manually overridden this behavior. From then
on, the project completion status must be edited manually; it will no longer
respond to changes in phase completion status. (Actually, you can restore the
default behavior by typing <code><b>DEFAULT</b></code> in the project
completion date input field on the plan summary form.)</p>

<h2 NO_NUMBER>Why should I bother marking tasks/projects complete?</h2>

<P>It is worth remembering that the "To Date" data entries, the data analysis
reports, and the PROBE tool only use data from components that are marked
complete, so it is good to make a habit of marking your components and tasks
complete, either with the completion checkbox or via the Project Plan Summary
form.</p>

<P>Also remember that the Task and Schedule tool tracks your progress by
looking to see which tasks have been marked complete, so it is good to make a
habit of marking tasks complete.  To help you keep track of what has and
hasn't been marked complete, the task selection menus will use a strikethrough
font to display the name of completed tasks.</p>
