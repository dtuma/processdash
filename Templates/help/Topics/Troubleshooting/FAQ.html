</UL>

<P><HR><a name="NoServer"></a><B>My web browser displays an error message 
   when I try to view a script/form/chart/report/etc.  What is wrong?</B>

<P>The dashboard actually contains a very small HTTP server that provides all
the web content and thus the content cannot be displayed when the dashboard is
not running.  If you get an error message like "The page cannot be displayed -
cannot find server," check to make certain that the dashboard
is running.</p>

<P>If the dashboard <b>is</b> running, and you have <b>never</b> been able to
 view a script/form/chart/report, it may be that you need to adjust your proxy
 settings.  Many people work at companies where they do not have a direct
 connection to the internet, but instead must connect to the web via an HTTP
 proxy server. If this describes you, you may need to tell your browser to
 bypass the proxy for the address "localhost". The instructions below may not
 apply to your browser word-for-word, but should hopefully get you pointed in
 the right direction:
  <UL>
   <LI>For Internet Explorer, choose &quot;Tools <img 
      src="../../Images/rarrow.png"> Internet Options&quot;. Click on
      the &quot;Connections&quot; tab, then on the &quot;LAN
      Settings&quot; button. Make certain the &quot;Bypass proxy
      server for local addresses&quot; box is
      <b><strong>checked</strong></b>.</li>
  </UL>

<p><hr><a name="BrokenForms"></a><b>My web browser is able to show the forms, 
but none of the entry blanks have any information.  What is wrong?</b>

<p>The dashboard uses web browsers in unique and innovative
ways. Unfortunately, some browsers aren't up to the task. If you can
see the HTML forms but they don't seem to be talking to the Dashboard,
then it is likely that your browser (or the Java environment within
your browser) is encountering problems.</p>

<p>Your first step should be to ensure that you are using one of the
browsers recommended for use with the dashboard. (See the
<a href="../Overview/HowToInstall.html">installation help topic</a> for
more information.)</p>

<p>If you are using one of the approved browsers and you still have
this problem, please send us an email at
<u>processdash-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</u> and we will attempt to 
help you with the problem.</p>

<P><hr><A NAME="ChooseJVM"></A><b>I have several versions of the Java Runtime
Environment on my computer. How can I tell the dashboard which one to use?</b>

<P>(These instructions apply to Windows.)&nbsp;
<ol>
  <li>Right-click on the icon you use to run the dashboard, and choose
    Properties</li>
  <li>The &quot;Target&quot; field will contain &quot;C:\Program Files\Process
    Dashboard\pspdash.jar&quot;. Change it to read (all on one line):<br><br>
      <code><FONT SIZE="-2">&quot;C:\Program&nbsp;Files\JavaSoft\JRE\1.7\bin\java&quot; -jar &quot;C:\Program&nbsp;Files\Process&nbsp;Dashboard\pspdash.jar&quot;</font></code><br><br>
    (Of course, you may need to modify the path to the &quot;java&quot; program
    if it is slightly different on your computer.)
     </li>
</ol>

<P><hr><A NAME="hybridMode"></A><b>Our Team Dashboard is displaying the
 "toolbar" user interface designed for personal data collection. How can I fix
 this?</b>

<p>In most cases, when you create a team dashboard or personal dashboard, it
will automatically be configured with a flag indicating the dataset type.
However, if you have an older Team Dashboard that contains a mixture of team
projects and accidentally created personal projects, the dashboard may not be
able to infer the correct dataset type, and it may display the "toolbar" user
interface that is designed to help individuals collect data.  If this occurs,
you can fix the problem by choosing &quot;<img src="../../Images/cmenu.png">
&rarr; Tools &rarr; Preferences &rarr; Advanced&quot; and setting the
"datasetMode" parameter to "team".</p>


<P><hr><A NAME="TwoForms"></A><b>If I have a dashboard script or form open,
and I click the script button to open another form, the new form appears in
my existing browser window, replacing the old form. Why can't I have two
forms open at once?</b>

<P>You can have as many scripts and forms open as you like! The behavior
you are seeing is a Microsoft "feature" designed to reduce clutter on your
screen. Fortunately, you can alter that behavior. The instructions below
may not apply to your browser word-for-word, but should hopefully get you
pointed in the right direction:

<OL>
  <LI>In Internet Explorer, choose "Tools <img 
      src="../../Images/rarrow.png"> Internet Options".</LI>
  <LI>Click the "Advanced" tab.</LI>
  <LI>Remove the checkmark next to the option, "Reuse windows for
      launching shortcuts."</LI>
</OL>

<P><HR><a name="NoConnection"></a><B>All my data elements say "NO 
CONNECTION".  What is wrong?</B>

<P>The forms always display "live" data - this allows them to auto-recalculate
numbers (like a spreadsheet does) when you edit data.  It also allows changes
made in one browser window to appear immediately in other browser windows. To
make all this happen, the browser maintains an open connection to the
dashboard, and passes data back and forth across this connection.</P>

<P>If you are viewing a form, and you close the main dashboard window, this
open connection is closed as well.  When this occurs, the form immediately
displays "NO CONNECTION" to let you know that your changes are no longer making
it back to the dashboard's data repository. To fix the problem, you must
<OL>
 <LI>restart the dashboard</li>
 <LI>click the refresh/reload button on your browser.</li>
</OL>

<p>If you have just opened a page containing a lot of data, the dashboard
may need time to perform the calculations.  It will display "CALCULATING"
while the data is prepared to let you know that the form is not ready
yet.</p>

<P><HR><a name="ERROR"></a><B>Some of my data elements say
"<code>#VALUE!</code>" or "<code>#DIV/0!</code>". What is wrong?</B>

<P>"<code>#VALUE!</code>" indicates that the dashboard cannot calculate a 
value because the formula references a value that is missing (displayed as 
"<CODE>?????</CODE>") or otherwise invalid (for example, a value like 
"<CODE>foo</CODE>" when a number was expected).  When you see 
"<code>#VALUE!</code>" in a dashboard form, it almost <I>always</I> means 
that there is a "<code>?????</code>" field somewhere that you still need to 
fill in. If you fill in all the "<code>?????</code>" fields and the 
"<code>#VALUE!</code>" field does not recalculate, check to ensure that the 
calculation is not <A HREF="../Planning/EnteringData.html#dataFreezing">frozen</A>.</P>

<P>"<code>#DIV/0!</code>" indicates that the dashboard encounted a 
divide-by-zero error when calculating a particular data value. Many times 
this is due to having a very small number of usable data points recorded by 
the dashboard.  For instance, if you start the dashboard for the first time 
and try to look at Process Summary forms for a PSP2.1 process, the "% To 
Date" fields will be filled with "<code>#DIV/0!</code>".  This is because the 
total amount of time recorded in the tool is 0.  The percentage calculation 
attempts to divide by zero and returns the error.</P> 

<P>Another problem can contribute to this condition as well.  If you are not 
in the habit of clicking the little "completion" checkbox at the right end of 
the dashboard, some (or all) of your data will be ignored by the dashboard 
when creating reports and graphs.  The reporting features of the dashboard 
only report tasks/projects that are marked as complete.  See the <a 
href="../Execution/CompletionButton.html">Using the Completion Checkbox</a> 
help topic for more information.</P>

<P><HR><a name="BadExcel"></a><B>I tried to export my data to Excel with the 
link on one of the forms, but I just got a small text file.  What is 
wrong?</B>

<P>For the "Export to Excel" functionality to work seamlessly, you must have 
the ".IQY" file type properly set up on your system.  This setup is normally 
performed by Microsoft Office during the installation process for Excel
(although, notably, certain releases of Office 97 do not perform this
setup).</p>

<P>If the IQY file type is not properly set up, clicking the "Export to 
Excel" links may instead cause Notepad to appear with a short, three-line 
text file. Alternatively, that three line text file might appear in an Excel 
spreadsheet.</p>

<P>If you encounter such problems, the simplest fix is to add the
following setting to the "Advanced" section of the
<a href="../AdvancedTopics/PreferencesTool.html">preferences editor</a>:

<pre> excel.exportMethod=mime</pre>

<p>And data will be exported to Excel <A
HREF="../PostmortemAnalysis/ExportingData.html#static">statically</A>.</P>

<P><HR><a name="NoSubmit"></A><B>Why is there no "submit" button on the HTML 
forms?</B>

<P>The HTML forms used by the dashboard are continually "live".  There is no 
need to press a submit button to send your data to the dashboard.  Simply 
enter your data where necessary, and the dashboard will record it.  However,
after editing a data field, it is usually necessary to leave that field for
your changes to take effect.  You can press the TAB button or click somewhere
else on the page. If the data you are changing is related to other data items 
on the page, you should see the other data elements update. For more
information, see the <A HREF="../Planning/EnteringData.html">Entering process 
data</A> help topic.</P>


<P><HR><a name="TimerUpdate"></a><B>I've started the timer, but none of the 
numbers on my reports are changing.  How can I know that it is working?</b>

<p>When the timer is running and you first navigate to an activity, the
dashboard will not create an entry in the time log until you have spent a full
minute there; this is by design.  For a more detailed explanation, see the
help topic for the <a href="../Execution/PlayPause.html#timelogdelay">play /
pause button</a>.</P>

<P>Also, the dashboard will make a quiet "tick" sound whenever the timer 
starts and when a new project or project phase is chosen by the hierarchy 
menus when the timer is running. If you do not hear this sound, check the 
state of the play/pause button.  The current state of the timer can always be 
determined by positioning the mouse pointer over the play/pause button.  A 
tooltip help will pop up containing the current state.</p> 


<P><HR><a name="FrozenData"></a><B>I made a mistake in one of my numbers on 
the Project Plan Summary form, but the form won't let me change the numbers! 
What can I do?</b>

<P>The dashboard will "freeze" your planning data once you have completed the 
planning phase by clicking the completion checkbox.  Also it will freeze all 
the data when the project is marked as complete.  You can make these numbers 
editable by marking either the project or the planning phase incomplete 
again.  For more info on freezing data see the <a 
href="../Planning/EnteringData.html#dataFreezing">data freezing</a> and the <a 
href="../Execution/CompletionButton.html">completion checkbox</a> help 
topics.</p>


<P><HR><a name="FormsColors"></a><b>What is the significance of the different 
text colors on the PSP process scripts and forms?</b>

<P>In his book <I>A Self-Improvement Process for Software Engineers</I>
where he outlines
the Personal Software Process, Watts Humphrey introduces the various process 
elements for doing PSP work in a graduated manner.  Each PSP process is built 
upon the previous one.  As a way of showing which process elements were added 
to the previous process definition, the forms in the book highlight the new 
process elements in <b><i>bold italics</i></b>.  These highlighted elements
return to normal text at the next process level. In our attempt to make our
online forms as identical to the PSP forms as possible, we have included that
detail.</P>

<P>However, the Process Dashboard makes certain steps on the scripts and forms
unnecessary (e.g. instructions to sum up various data items -- the dashboard
sums them for you).  These unnecessary process steps are displayed as
greyed-out text.</P>

<P>Also, there are places where the dashboard <i>slightly</i> changes the way
certain steps are performed (e.g.  instead of performing a PROBE calculation,
the PROBE tool should be used).  Green text is used to indicate this slight
departure from the <i>true</i> PSP scripts and forms.</P>

<P><HR><a name="PrototypicalData"></a><b>What is &quot;Prototypical PSP Data?&quot;  I'm seeing it in some of the charts and reports.</b>

<P>When you first begin using the dashboard, you have no historical
data.  As a result, previous versions of the dashboard would display
&quot;#DIV/0!&quot; in the &quot;Plan&quot; column of your first
project if it was based upon anything other than a PSP0 process.</P>

<P>Beginning with version 1.6.2, the dashboard will detect that you
have no historical data, and introduce an example dataset based upon
industry data and best practices.  The dashboard uses this dataset to
calculate the plan for your first PSP project.</P>

<P>As soon as you complete at least one PSP project, this example
dataset will disappear.  In the meantime, it may appear in various
dashboard charts and reports.</P>


<P><HR><a name="ExtDocFail"></a><b>I click on a document hyperlink in a 
process script, but the document never opens.</b>

<P>For maximum portability, the document templates provided with the 
dashboard are rich text files (.rtf). Some browsers don't know what to do
with a rich text file, and so they prompt you to save it (not very helpful).
To solve this problem, you must:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Obtain a program capable of editing rich text files, and install it
   on your machine. ("Open Office" is one possibility; it is free and runs 
   on Linux. Visit <u>http://www.openoffice.org/</u>)</LI>
  <LI>Configure your web browser, and tell it that files ending with ".rtf" 
   and/or files of mime type "application/rtf" should be opened with the 
   program you just installed.</LI>
</OL>

<p><hr><a name="ProcessTweak"></a><b>I'd like to make a minor change to a process script someone else wrote.  Can I do that?</b>

<p>Yes you can!  Please see the section on <a 
href="../AdvancedTopics/ProcessDefinition/HowDashboardFindsFiles.html#OverwritingScript">overwriting 
process scripts</a> in the help topic that describes how the dashboard finds 
the script files.</p>

<P><HR><a name="WhereData"></a><B>Where is my PSP data stored?</B>
<P>The dashboard stores all of your data in a single directory, in plain text
files.  This directory is often referred to in this documentation as the "data
directory".</p>

<P>You can find out the exact location of your data directory by
choosing &quot;Help <img src="../../Images/rarrow.png"> About Process
Dashboard&quot; from the configuration menu, then clicking on the
Configuration tab.</p>

<p>With the current default configuration, data is always stored in the
"current working directory" when the dashboard is run.</P>

<P><b>On Windows systems</b>, the "current working directory" is set by the
icon you use to run the dashboard.  Right-click on that icon and choose
"Properties"</p><ul>

<li>Typically, the data directory will be shown in the field labelled
"Start in:".  Altering this value will change the location where the
dashboard looks for your data.</li>

<li>Alternately, the location may be specified as an argument at the end of
the "Target" field.  In this case, the "Target" field will have an argument
of the form
<tt>"-location=<b>&lt;some&nbsp;data&nbsp;location&gt;</b>"</tt>.  Changing
this argument will point the shortcut to a different data location.</p>

</ul>

<P><b>On Mac OS X systems</b>, the data directory is set by the Application
icon you use to run the dashboard.  Ctrl-click on that icon, and choose
"Show Package Contents."  Then find the file "Resources/dataLocation.txt".
You can edit this file to change the location where your data is
stored.</p>

<P><b>On Unix/Linix systems</b>, the current working directory is
controlled by the shell script or icon you use to launch the dashboard.
See <a href="#UnixClutteredHomeDir">this FAQ question</a> below for more
information.</P>

<p>It is possible to have multiple, independent data directories all on the
same machine; just make copies of the icon you use to start the dashboard,
and configure each icon with a different data location.</P>


<P><HR><a name="MoveData"></A><B>How can I backup my psp data and/or move it 
to another computer?</B>

<P>If you want to backup your psp data, simply back up the contents of your
<a href="#WhereData">data directory</a>.  To move your psp data to a different
computer,</p>

<UL>
<LI>stop the dashboard if it is running</LI>
<LI>copy the contents of your data directory to a directory on the new
    computer</LI>
<LI>run the dashboard on the new computer, using the chosen directory as the
    data directory.</LI></UL>


<p><hr><a name="CorruptFiles"></a><b>I got a warning box that claims that my data files have been corrupted!  Can I get my data back?</b>

<p>If you did not continue running the dashboard when the dialog warned you 
that doing so could be quite dangerous, then yes, you probably can.</p>

<p>If you see this message, realize that the dashboard is being overly cautious
with your data.  As long as you didn't plow on ahead and run the dashboard 
with the questionable files in place, no data has been lost yet.  The best 
steps to take next are:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Examine the corrupt files mentioned in the warning message.  If they are 
   of zero length, then there is most likely nothing to worry about. Just 
   delete the zero length files and restart the dashboard.</li>
 <li>If the files contain something, examine their contents.  Removing the 
   "tttt" at the beginning of the filename should indicate what <em>real</em> 
   file was being created at the time the problem was detected. See if the 
   temporary files contain any data that is missing from the original file, 
   and copy it over if necessary.  Finally, delete the temporary files and 
   restart the dashboard.</li>
</ol>

<p>Even though the Dashboard has been designed to be safe with your precious 
process data, it is still a good idea to back up the Dashboard's data 
directory every so often.  See the question about <a href="#MoveData">backing 
up your Dashboard data</a> for more information.</p>


<p><hr><a name="UnixClutteredHomeDir"></a><b>I'm on a Unix/Linux
system, and the dashboard is cluttering my home directory with lots of
files!  How do I fix this?</b></p>

<p>When you start the dashboard (whether on Linux, Windows, or any
other operating system), it uses the "current working directory" for
data storage.</p>
 
<p>On Windows, the installer program automatically creates a shortcut
for the user which launches the dashboard with the appropriate current
working directory, as selected during the installation process.</p>
 
<p>Unfortunately, the installer is not able to create shortcuts on all
Linux/Unix platforms yet, so it may up to you to create an appropriate
launcher manually. The dashboard does its best to help you out, by
creating a shell script in your chosen data directory called
"<tt>run-dash.sh</tt>". Take a look at the contents of that shell
script. Embedded comments in that file include some helpful
information; for example, If java and/or firefox are not in your
path, you may need to edit a particular line of the script. With those
edits, you should be able to use the script to launch the
dashboard.</p>

<p>If you have already started using the dashboard and you've already
created projects in your hierarchy that you want to keep, you can move
them by carefully following the steps below:
<ul>
  <li><b>Shut down the dashboard if it is running. Do not skip this
      step!</b></li>

  <li>Find files in your home directory matching any of the following
      patterns, and move them into your chosen data directory:

<pre>    global.dat       time.log           .pspdash
    ###.dat          timelog.xml        pspdash.ini
    ###.def          timelog2.xml       state</pre></li>

  <li>Edit the <tt>run-dash.sh</tt> file in your data directory as
      necessary.  Then create a launcher for <tt>run-dash.sh</tt>
      within your desktop environment (e.g. Gnome / KDE).</li>

</ul></p>


<p><hr><a name="HideFinished"></a><b>Can I hide my finished projects from the 
hierarchy browser (and other screens)?  They are starting to pile up and are 
taking up a lot of space.</b>

<p>Unfortunately, No.  We have this as a feature request.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Cut and Paste features in the hierarchy browser will 
allow you to move your completed projects away from the part of the hierarchy 
where you are doing your active development.  You could create a node at the 
top of the project hierarchy called "Archived Projects" and Cut and Paste 
your finished projects as children under it.  They would still count towards 
your PROBE Estimates and your Planning data.  See the <a 
href="../Planning/UsingHierarchyEditor.html">hierarchy editor</a> help topic
for more information.</p>


<p><hr><a name="OutlierProject"></a><b>I have a project in my hierarchy that 
doesn't have much to do with my current development habits.  Can I mark it as 
an "outlier" so that it doesn't corrupt the Planning and PROBE estimates?</b>

<p>There are basically two concerns when in this kind of situation.</p>
<ol>
 <li>Removing the project from PROBE Estimates</li>
 <li>Removing the project from Planning and To Date calculations</li>
</ol>

<p>The most important time to identify a project as an outlier is during 
PROBE-style linear regression.  This is easy to do; when using the PROBE 
tool, you can click on the "Chart" button to visually identify outliers, 
and the "Filter" button to remove any outliers from the regression 
calculation.  The PROBE Wizard will also let you remove various data pairings 
from the regression calculation, but it won't show you a graph and thus isn't 
as intuitive.  See the <a href="../Planning/UsingProbeTool.html">PROBE 
Tool</a> and <a href="../Planning/UsingProbeWizard.html">PROBE Wizard</a> 
help topics for more information.</p>

<p>To remove a project's effects from Planning and To Date calculations, you 
can make use of multiple data sets.  By defining a customized data set for 
your current project, you can isolate only the data you know is applicable.  
See the <a href="../AdvancedTopics/MultipleToDateData.html">multiple To Date 
data</a> help topic for more information.</p>

<p>A less desireable but simpler way to remove a project's effects would be 
to mark the project as incomplete.  The To Date, Planning, and PROBE 
calculations only use completed projects for their data sets.  The drawback 
with this approach is that you will lose the accurate completion date for the 
project that you mark incomplete.</p>

<P><HR><a name="WebServerWorms"></a><b>Since the dashboard has a web server in it, do I have to worry about internet worms and viruses attacking my machine?</b>

<P>A good question! The short answer: the web server built into the
dashboard is NOT susceptible to any existing worms or viruses, and the
default dashboard settings make it impossible for other computers to
connect to your dashboard.</P>

<P>The longer answer: the web handling logic in the dashboard is based on
Jetty, a widely-used and thoroughly reviewed open-source web server.  The
broad user base and continual review process help to make Jetty very secure.

<P>Fortunately, because the dashboard is written in Java rather than C/C++, it
is not susceptible to many common hacking techniques like buffer overruns (a
common worm infection strategy). This means that even if a hacker was
interested in writing an attack targeted at the dashboard, the worst thing
they could probably do is to crash your running dashboard program.</P>

<P>If this information doesn't allay your concerns, you can use the
"http.allowRemote" setting to ensure that it is impossible for other 
computers to connect to the dashboard (this is the default).  See the 
<a href="../AdvancedTopics/ConfigurationFile.html#http.allowRemote">advanced
settings</a> help topic for more information.</P>


<P><HR><A NAME="AutoUpdate"></A><b>When the dashboard starts up, it's
attempting to make a connection to the internet.  Why is it doing
this?</b>

<p>Like many modern software programs, the dashboard provides an
"update notification" feature.  Once a month, this feature checks to
see if an updated version of the dashboard is available.  If you have
installed add-on process sets, it also checks to see if updated
versions of these are available.</p>

<p>If new versions are available, the dashboard will display an alert,
listing the items which have been updated.  This alert has a checkbox
which reads "Don't perform a monthly check for new releases."  If you
check this box, the dashboard will never perform this check again.
You can also disable this check manually by unmarking the appropriate
box in the <a href="../AdvancedTopics/PreferencesTool.html">preferences
editor</a>.</p>

<p>In the normal case, this "update check" will succeed, and the
dashboard will make a note not to check for another 30 days.  However,
the update check might fail if no network is available (for example,
because you are running the dashboard on a laptop that isn't connected
to the network).  As a result, if the update check fails for any
reason, the update checking logic will try again the next time you
start the dashboard.</p>

<p>If you see the dashboard attempt to check every time it starts up,
this means that the update check is never completing successfully.
This could occur if your personal firewall is blocking the connection,
or if you are behind a password-protected corporate firewall.  In
either case, you can turn off this feature entirely as described
above.</p>


<P><HR><a name="DCRSCR"></a><b>What happened to the DCR and SCR processes?</b>

<P>The DCR and SCR processes were shipped with version 1.1 of the
Process Dashboard.  They were later removed from the main dashboard
and distributed as add-on process sets.  As of version 1.4.1, they are
no longer available.</P>

<P>Explicit written permission from Addison-Wesley is required to modify
PSP scripts or distribute modified PSP scripts.  Since the DCR/SCR process
scripts were derived from the copyrighted PSP process scripts in <i>A
Discipline for Software Engineering</i>, they fall into this category.
We have not attempted to obtain that permission from Addison-Wesley, so
these processes are no longer available.</p>

<P><HR><a name="Auto"></a><B>I would like to integrate the dashboard more 
closely with my IDE. Is it possible to programatically start/stop the timer, 
change the active hierarchy path, and open the defect dialog?</B>

<p>As of Process Dashboard 2.5, a Visual Studio plugin is available that makes
it easy to collect metrics without leaving your IDE.  Contact the development
team if you are interested in using this functionality.</p>

<p>If you are interested in developing integration for another IDE, take a
look at the various <a href="http://www.processdash.com/restApi"
target="_blank">REST APIs</a> that the dashboard publishes.  Your plugin can
interact with those APIs to retrieve and modify UI state.</p>

<p>For much simpler mashups (such as quick links in a webpage), a handful of
older APIs are still available. For example, if you issue an HTTP request of
the form:

<PRE><FONT SIZE="-2">http://localhost:2468/control/startTiming.class</FONT></PRE>

the dashboard timer will start.  Similarly, an HTTP request of the form:

<PRE><FONT SIZE="-2">http://localhost:2468/control/stopTiming.class</FONT></PRE>

will pause the timer. And

<PRE><FONT SIZE="-2">http://localhost:2468/Non+Project/foo//control/setPath.class</FONT></PRE>

will change the current hierarchy path to "/Non Project/foo". If you want
to change the current hierarchy path <b>and</b> start the timer, use

<PRE><FONT SIZE="-2">...//control/setPath.class<B>?start</B></FONT></PRE>

<P>To open the defect dialog and log a new defect against the active task (the
same action as clicking the defect button), use

<PRE><FONT SIZE="-2">http://localhost:2468/control/showDefectDialog</FONT></PRE>

To open the defect dialog and edit an existing defect, use

<PRE><FONT SIZE="-2">http://localhost:2468/Project/Foo/Some+task//control/showDefectDialog?id=42</FONT></PRE>

where "/Project/Foo/Some+task" is the URL-encoded project/path that the defect
was logged against, and "42" is the ID of the existing defect. (These values
can be seen in the Defect Log Editor.)

<p><B>Note</B>: these commands will have no effect unless the HTTP
request originates from the same machine where the dashboard is
running.
