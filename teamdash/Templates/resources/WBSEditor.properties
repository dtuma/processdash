    Although you opened the work breakdown structure in read-write\n\
    mode, your connection to the network was broken, and your lock\n\
    on the WBS was lost.  In the meantime, another individual has\n\
    opened the work breakdown structure for editing, so your lock\n\
    could not be reclaimed.\n\

    As a result, you will no longer be able to save changes to the\n\
    work breakdown structure.  You are strongly encouraged to close\n\
    and reopen the work breakdown structure editor.

    cleanups of completed tasks, and to label or categorize\n\
    items in support of postmortem data analysis. \n\
    \ \n\
    However, you should not create new tasks in this WBS or\n\

    \ \n\

    \    wish to apply your offline changes, and no one else has altered\n\
    \    the real project WBS in the meantime\n\
    \ \n\
    When you perform a "replace data" operation, all of the data in the\n\
    current plan will be discarded and replaced with the data from the\n\
    file you specify.  Please ensure that this is your intent.\n\

    When you open the Work Breakdown Structure Editor\n\
    from your personal dashboard, the WBS will enter\n\
    "personal editing optimized mode" by default.  This\n\
    mode is designed to make it easier for you to alter\n\
    your personal plan.  For example, when you create a\n\
    new task, it will automatically be assigned to you.\n\
    \ \n\
    In addition, the WBS Editor will display a warning\n\
    if you make a change that affects a coworker's plan.\n\
    By heeding these warnings, you can make changes to\n\
    your plan with confidence, knowing that you won't\n\
    accidentally alter someone else's plan.\n\
    \ \n\
    "Personal editing optimized mode" can be very useful.\n\
    But there may be times that you wish to edit the full\n\
    team plan, including the plans of your team members.\n\
    Just open the "Team" menu and uncheck the box\n\
    labeled, "Optimizing Editing Operations for..."  This will\n\
    disable personal editing optimized mode.

WorkflowMap.Errors.Cannot_Find_Files_FMT=\
    Data for this workflow is stored in the directory: {0} \n\
    Unfortunately, that directory could not be found. \
    You may need to map a network drive to edit this data.
WorkflowMap.Errors.Cannot_Save_Server_FMT=\
    Data for this workflow is stored on the server at: {0} \n\
    Unfortunately, the dashboard was unable to contact the server to \
    save your changes. Please check your network connection.
WorkflowMap.Errors.Cannot_Save_File_FMT=\
    Data for this workflow is stored in the directory: {0} \n\
    Unfortunately, the dashboard was unable to save data to the files in \
    that directory. This problem might have been caused by poor network \
    connectivity, or by read-only file permissions. Please check to ensure \
    that you can write to that location.
WorkflowMap.Errors.Read_Only_Files_FMT=\
    Data for this workflow is stored in the directory: {0} \n\
    Unfortunately, the current filesystem permissions do not allow \
    you to modify the files in that directory.
WorkflowMap.Errors.Cannot_Create_Lock_FMT=\
    Data for this workflow is stored in the directory: {0} \n\
    The dashboard attempted to lock those files for writing, but the \
    operating system was unable to secure a write lock.  This is an \
    unusual situation, possibly caused by the current configuration of \
    the remote network directory.
