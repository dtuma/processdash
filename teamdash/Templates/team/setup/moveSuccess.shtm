    <p>In the near future, the Personal Dashboard for each team member

    <p class="error">Unfortunately, the dashboard was unable to update
    the links between this project and its master project.</p>

    <p>According to the dashboard's records, this project belongs to
    the master project "<!--#echo masterPrefix -->". However, no
    master project could be found by that name.  This problem could
    occur if you renamed the master project at some point in the
    past.</p>

    <p>As a result, you will need to update the master project links
    manually.  Using the main dashboard toolbar, please select the
    master project that this project belongs to, and choose the
    <b>Edit List of Subprojects</b> option.  Then remove and re-add
    this subproject to the list.</p>
