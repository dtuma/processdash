<p>The team-oriented processes in the dashboard use a &quot;team
directory&quot; to facilitate coordination.  This directory will be used to
hold team-level planning information, such as the project's work breakdown
structure.</p>

<p>The &quot;team directory&quot; must be accessible and readable by the
leaders of all the team projects associated with this master project.
Because of this, it should generally be a shared network directory.<p>

<!--#else-->

<p>The team-oriented processes in the dashboard use a &quot;team
directory&quot; to facilitate coordination.  The primary purpose of
this directory is to hold exported snapshots of individual data; the
team project instance imports this data and uses it to compute
rolled-up team data.</p>

<p>The &quot;team directory&quot; must be accessible, readable, and
writable by all team members.  Because of this, it should generally be
a shared network directory.  Since the directory will hold PSP data
collected by individuals, it should be configured with permissions
that forbid file access by non-team members.<p>

<p>The data for this project is <b>currently</b> located in the
following directory:</p>

<p>That data directory is a specially named subdirectory appearing

Directory</b>, which is:</p>
