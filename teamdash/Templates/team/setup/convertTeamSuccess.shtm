<h1>Team Project Conversion Complete</h1>

<p>In the team dashboard, &quot;<!--#echo PATH_TRANSLATED -->&quot;
has been successfully converted to the
"<!--#echo [Team_Process_PID] -->" metrics collection framework.</p>

<p>You (or another member of your team) should open the team Work
Breakdown Structure as soon as possible, and repair the component and
task types that appear throughout the WBS.  Also repair the node types
in the Common Team Workflows.</p>

<p>Team Members should now restart their personal dashboard.  After
restart, they will receive a notification advising them to convert
their personal plan.  They should click "OK" on this notification to
proceed with the conversion.</p>
