<h1>Team Project Migration Complete</h1>

<p>In the team dashboard, &quot;<!--#echo PATH_TRANSLATED -->&quot;
has been successfully migrated to the new-style data format.</p>

<p>If you also intend to <a href="convert">convert this team
project</a> to a different metrics collection framework, you are
encouraged to do that now.  Performing the conversion right now will
enable team members to undergo a single migration step instead of two
separate steps.</p>

<p>Team Members should now restart their personal dashboard.  After
restart, they will receive a notification advising them to migrate
their personal plan.  They should click "OK" on this notification to
proceed with the migration.</p>
