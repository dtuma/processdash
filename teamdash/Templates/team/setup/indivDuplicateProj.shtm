<p>When a team uses the Process Dashboard, they typically create a
personal dashboard for each team member, and a separate dashboard to
perform team rollups.  However, it appears that you are attempting to
place the data for an individual inside the same dashboard as the team
rollup.  This mode of operation is discouraged.</p>

<p>If you are currently running the Team Dashboard and a personal
dashboard on the same computer, there is a slight chance that this
might have occurred by accident.  Please try closing the Team
Dashboard and the personal dashboard, starting them back up, and
beginning the joining process again.</p>

<!--#else -->

<p>This wizard helps you to join your personal Process Dashboard to a
team project.  However, it appears that you have already joined this
dashboard to this team project.  The previous join operation created
your personal plan at the following path in your task hierarchy:</p>

<pre>    <!--#echo personalRoot --></pre>

<p>Now, you are attempting to join this personal dashboard to the same
project a second time.  This is usually an accident.</p>

<ul>

<li>If you are an individual team member, you can close this window.
    You are already joined to the team project, so no additional steps
    are necessary.</li>

<li>If you are a team leader, and you are attempting to create
    personal plans for several individuals, you should close all of
    the personal dashboards that are currently open.  Then, open only
    one personal dashboard, join it to the team project, close it, and
    move on to the next dashboard.  (For the joining process to be
    successful, only one personal dashboard can be open at a time.)</li>

<li>In some unusual planning scenarios, a team leader might
    intentionally desire to join the team project several times from a
    single personal dashboard (for example, to simulate several
    hypothetical team members).  If this applies to you,
