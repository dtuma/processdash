<h1>Migrating Team Project</h1>

<p>The Process Dashboard will now shut down to begin the migration
process for the project &quot;<!--#echo PATH_TRANSLATED -->&quot;.
When the migration process is complete, the dashboard will restart.
After the dashboard restarts, you should synchronize this project to
the team Work Breakdown Structure.</p>
