<!--#elif cannotMigrate -->
    <p>&quot;<!--#echo PATH_TRANSLATED -->&quot; can not be migrated
    
    <!--#if bridgedMode -->because the dashboard is currently running
        in bridged mode through a team server.  The migration tool
        does not support the migration of bridged dashboard instances
	at this time.

    <!--#elif dirClasspath -->because the dashboard is currently
        running from unpackaged class files instead of a packaged
	JAR file.
