<h2>Cannot Move <!--#echo [move//Team] --> Project</h2>

<!--#if notTeamProject -->

<p>This wizard is designed for use in the Team Dashboard, to relocate
data for a Team Project or a Master Project.  You are attempting to
use it on some other project type, which is not supported.</p>

<!--#elif hasURL -->

<p>The Process Dashboard currently does not provide support for moving
<!--#echo [move//team] --> projects that are registered with a Team
Server. If you need to move this <!--#echo [move//team] --> project,
please contact the Process Dashboard development team for
assistance.</p>

<!--#elif noProjectID -->

<p><!--#echo [move//Team] --> Projects are described by a unique
Project ID.  The Project ID for this project appears to be missing.
This is a serious error; the move operation cannot continue.</p>

<!--#elif noTeamDir -->

<p>This wizard is designed to relocate <!--#echo [move//team] -->
project data from its existing location to a new location.
Unfortunately, the existing location of the data is currently unknown.
You must enter the location of the <b><!--#echo [move//Team] -->
Project Network Directory</b> on the Project Parameters and Settings
page before you can continue.</p>

<!--#elif badTeamDir -->

<p>This wizard is designed to relocate <!--#echo [move//team] -->
project data from its existing location to a new location.  From the
information on the Project Parameters and Settings page, the
<!--#echo [move//team] --> project data should currently be located at:</p>

<pre><!--#echo path --></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, that directory doesn't appear to exist.  To resolve
this problem, you may need to map a network drive, or repair the
values on the Project Parameters and Settings page.</p>

<!--#elif emptyTeamDir -->

<p>This wizard is designed to relocate <!--#echo [move//team] -->
project data from its existing location to a new location.  From the
information on the Project Parameters and Settings page, the
<!--#echo [move//team] --> project data should currently be located at:</p>

<pre><!--#echo path --></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, that directory doesn't appear to contain
<!--#echo [move//team] --> project data.  To correct this problem,
you may need to repair the values on the Project Parameters and
Settings page.</p>

<!--#elif teamDirInUse -->

<p>The data for this project cannot move the data for this project,
because the WBS is currently open for editing<!--#if lockOwner -->
by <!--#echo lockOwner --><!--#endif-->. Please address this
problem, then start the move process again.
