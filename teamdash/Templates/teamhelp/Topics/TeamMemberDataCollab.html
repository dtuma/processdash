<h1>Team Data Collaboration</h1>

<p>The Team Dashboard uses a
<a href="TeamDashboardOrganization.html">peer-to-peer architecture</a>
to share data and facilitate collaboration.  This unique approach
offers a number of benefits:</p>

<ul>

<li>It makes it possible for you to collect data and refine your plan,
even when you're offline.</li>

<li>It gives you the ability to perform detailed analyses of your
personal data, so the data you collect works as hard for <i>you</i> as
it does for the project.</li>

<li>It helps to preserve the privacy of your personal data, sharing
only the minimum information needed for team reports and rollups.</li>

<li>It provides you with a long-standing personal database of
<i>all</i> your historical data, even if you've been a part of many
different projects, teams, and organizations.  This database empowers
you to analyze trends in your personal growth, find opportunities for
improvement, and make better plans in the future.</li>

</ul>

<p>These benefits are possible because your Process Dashboard includes
a standalone database of personal metrics that is distinct from the
Team Dashboard database.  But since the databases are distinct, it
becomes necessary to copy data back and forth periodically.  These
copies are performed by <a href="#syncWBS">sync</a> and
<a href="#export">export</a> operations.</p>

<h2><a name="syncWBS"></a>Synchronizing the Work Breakdown
Structure</h2>

<p>The <a href="EditingTheWBS.html">Work Breakdown Structure</a>
offers an easy-to-edit view of the consolidated team plan.  If you
open the WBS from your personal dashboard and save changes, those
changes will be applied to your plan automatically.</p>

<p>Personal plan ownership is important for a high-maturity team, so
the dashboard won't modify your personal plan without your knowledge.
If another member of your team makes a change to the WBS that affects
you, you'll need to pull these changes into your plan.  You can
request these changes by performing a Sync Work Breakdown Structure
operation.</p>

<p>If your team is using <a href="TeamConfigDirCloud.html">cloud
storage</a> for team data, make sure your cloud provider's sync client
is running and active.  The sync client needs to copy the latest WBS
data from the cloud before you can ask the Process Dashboard to sync
those changes into your personal plan.</p>

<p>In the Process Dashboard, click the script button and choose Sync
Work Breakdown Structure.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/indiv-scripts-sync.png"></p>

<p>If your plan is up-to-date, you'll see a message to that effect.
Otherwise, wait while the dashboard copies data from the team plan.
When the operation is complete, the dashboard will display a list of
the plan changes that were made.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/indiv-sync-success.png"></p>

<p>The Sync operation updates the plan for the currently selected
project.  If you're a member of more than one project, you can sync
the other projects by changing the
<a href="../../help/Topics/Execution/HierarchyMenus.html">active
task</a> and choosing Sync Work Breakdown Structure again.</p>


<h2><a name="export"></a>Exporting Personal Data</h2>

<p>The project data you collect is written in real-time into the
database in your personal dashboard.  But it isn't immediately
available for team rollups and reports.  Instead, it is published to
the Team Dashboard in the background:</p>

<ul>

<li>whenever the Process Dashboard shuts down</li>

<li>between midnight and 1 AM, if you leave your Process Dashboard
running continually</li>

<li>after any <a href="#syncWBS">Sync</a> operation that makes changes
to your plan</li>

</ul>

<p>If you've collected data and you'd like to make it available for
team reports immediately, you can perform an Export My Data Now
operation.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/indiv-scripts-export.png"></p>

<p>The Export operation publishes data for the currently selected
project.  If you're a member of more than one project, you can export
data for the other projects by changing the
<a href="../../help/Topics/Execution/HierarchyMenus.html">active
task</a> and choosing Export My Data Now again.</p>

<p>If your team is using <a href="TeamConfigDirCloud.html">cloud
storage</a> for team data, make sure your cloud provider's sync client
is running and active.  Your data isn't fully exported until the sync
client reports that all files are published and up-to-date.</p>
