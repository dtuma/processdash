<h1>Plan Project Development Process</h1>
<b>(TSP Launch Meeting No. 3)</b>

<p>In the next step of the project launch process, the team typically
formalizes the steps in their development process. To do this, you may
draw upon existing organizational processes, or you may define new
processes as a team during the launch. The team may create defined
processes, or they may simply identify common, repeatable workflows.
The Process Dashboard provides tools that assist with this task.</p>

<p>If your team is defining new processes from scratch, it is often a
good idea to use a whiteboard, easel, and other traditional meeting
aids to capture the team's ideas, as this helps to promote the free
flow of ideas. When the team processes begin to solidify, it is
helpful to have an individual enter these into the dashboard. (On the
other hand, if your process definitions take a long time to solidify,
it may be more helpful to wait until after the meeting is over to
enter the process steps into the dashboard.)</p>

<p>Processes and workflows are entered into the Common Team Workflows
Editor. From the Work Breakdown Structure Editor window, you can
access the Common Team Workflows Editor by selecting the Workflow menu
and choosing Edit Workflows.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/workflows-empty.png"></p>

<p>Processes and workflows are once again displayed hierarchically and
edited in an outline format. (For more in-depth information on editing
this outline, see the <a href="EditingTheWBS.html">Editing the Work
Breakdown Structure</a> help topic.) In this hierarchical outline,
each item that is a direct child of the Common Workflows node
represents a single <i>process</i> or <i>workflow</i>.  These items
are displayed with an etched rectangular icon (<img
border=0 width=18 height=12 src="../Images/icon-process.png">).  You
can designate a given node as a process or workflow by un-indenting it
as far to the left as possible.</p>

<p>Define the steps in a process or workflow by creating items
hierarchically underneath it. Underneath a process or workflow, you
can define documents that will be created and tasks that will be
performed. To define the type of each item you create, click on its
icon to display a menu. When defining a high-maturity process, make
certain to select the most appropriate process phase for each task you
create.</p>

<p>You are not limited in the number of processes/workflows you can
create. Each process/workflow, however, should be given a unique
name.</p>

<p>The columns on the right are completely optional, but entering data can
save you a great deal of time later.</p>

<ul>

<li style='margin-top:9pt'><a name="pct"></a>The <b>%</b> column provides
a convenient way to divide a larger task proportionately. Your team may
have historical data that tells you the typical amount of time that is
spent during each step of this workflow.  If you do not have
historical data, your team may wish to estimate these percentages
during the launch.  Either way, you can use the %&nbsp;column to
designate that breakdown, as shown in the following example:

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/workflow-percentage-example.png"></p>

<p>When you apply this workflow to a component in your team project,
the WBS Editor will look at the time you have estimated for that
component, and subdivide the time based upon the percentages you have
entered.  (If the numbers in a given workflow don't add up to exactly
100%, don't worry; the WBS Editor will treat them as "weights" and
normalize them to 100% when you apply the workflow.)</p></li>


<li style='margin-top:9pt'>The <b># People</b> column allows you to
indicate that a particular task is generally performed by a group of
individuals. For example, if you create a Peer Review task in your
process, you might wish to indicate that five people typically
participate in a Peer Review.</li>

<li style='margin-top:9pt'>The <b>Performed By</b> column allows you to
indicate who is responsible for each task in the workflow.  You can
enter the names of various arbitrary roles, like "author,"
"inspector," "tester," etc.  Each role name must be a single word,
made up only of letters.  If you have multiple people in a particular
role, give each a unique suffix, such as "reviewerA" and "reviewerB."
When you apply the workflow to a component in the WBS, these role
names will be displayed as placeholders like &#x00AB;author&#x00BB;.
You can click on the placeholders to assign all of the matching tasks
to a specific person.

<p>Occasionally, a workflow may include a task (such as a sign-off)
that is always performed by a certain team member.  You can enter that
team member's initials in the Performed By column, and when you apply
this workflow in the WBS, the task will automatically be assigned to
them.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The columns described above are used by most teams, so they are always
visible.  However, a number of optional/advanced columns are also available.
To enable these optional columns, click the Add Column button on the toolbar
(<img border="0" width="21" height="21" src="../Images/icon-add-column.png">),
and select from the following choices:</p>

<ul>

<li><a name="rate"></a>The <b>Rate</b> and <b>Units</b> columns can be
used to generate time estimates from size.  If you happen to know the
typical productivity rates (based on historical or estimated team
averages) for <u>all</u> the tasks in a workflow, you can enter those
rates in this column.  For example, you might wish to state that a Code
Review task takes place at a rate of 200 LOC/Hr, or that a PSP Task
completes at a rate of 20 LOC/Hr.  Here is an example for a possible
team software development process:

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/workflow-rate-example.png"></p>

<p>When you apply this workflow to a component in your team project,
the WBS Editor will look at the estimated size for the component.  It
will use that size, along with the percentages and productivity rates
you have entered, to generate an effort estimate for each task in the
component.</p>

<p>Note that that this behavior differs from the "percentage-only"
behavior described in the section above.  This is a very important
consideration.  When you examine a single team workflow, if <u>any</u>
task has a number in the Rate column, the workflow will use size
estimates to produce time/effort estimates.  If <u>no</u> rates are
present, the workflow will let you enter a top-level time estimate,
then use the percentages to spread the time across the tasks.  You
should decide which mode you wish to use for each workflow, then
either (a)&nbsp;leave the rate column blank, or (b)&nbsp;enter rates
for every task.</p>

<p>When a task in a workflow is performed by more than one person,
effort estimates will be generated differently based on the presence
of a value in the "%" column.  If you have placed a number in the "%"
column, the WBS will understand that this task is a percentage of an
overall workflow; so that percentage describes the total amount of
work that will be spread across those individuals.  If you leave the
"%" column blank and enter a Rate, the WBS will understand that each
individual is independently working at that rate.</p>

<p>An example illustrates this best.  When you examine the "Simple
Process" workflow above, three individuals will be working on the
"Code Inspection" task.  That task has been described as a task that
requires "200 LOC/Hr".  So if you apply this workflow to a component
that has 400 LOC, three people will be working on this task, and each
one will spend two hours.  In contrast, the "Integration Test" task
has been described as being 12% of a workflow that requires 10 LOC/Hr.
For a 400 LOC component, that end-to-end workflow will take 40 hours.
12% of 40 hours is 4.8 hours, so this is the total time that will be
allocated to the "Integration Test" task.  Three people are assigned,
and the time will be spread across them equally, so each one will
spend 1.6 hours.</p>

<p>The Rate column can be a useful way to produce times estimates, but
it does have a number of important limitations.  For example, it
requires the team to apply detailed workflows to "placeholder"
components in future iterations, just to answer high-level questions
about when the overall project could finish.  And it doesn't provide
flexibility for a single process to have a range of different rates
based on the complexity of a given component.  For these and other
reasons, the recommended best practice is to capture productivity
rates in <a href="PlanProjectStrategy.html#proxies">proxy estimation
tables</a>, leave the Rate column blank, and only use the percentage
column (as shown in the "Requirements Analysis" example
above).</p></li>


<li>The <b>Min Time</b> column can be used to specify the minimum time
for a particular workflow step. Values in this column should be
specified in hours, but you can enter a number smaller than 1.0 if
needed.

<p>This column can be helpful when a particular step is a very small
percentage of the overall workflow. Entering a minimum time can prevent the
task from receiving an impossibly small time estimate if the workflow is
applied to a small component.</p>

<p>This column also makes it possible to specify a fixed time for a
particular step.  Just enter the fixed time in this column, and leave
the percentage and rate columns blank.  (A blank percentage and rate is
equivalent to zero, so the task would normally receive no time; but that
zero will then be overridden by the time you enter in this column.)</p></li>


<li>The <b>Labels</b> column can contain any number of words, separated
by spaces or commas.  These values will automatically be entered into the
<a href="CreateBalancedPlan.html#taskLabels">Task Labels</a> column of the
WBS when the workflow is applied.  This provides a convenient shortcut
when you always wish to apply a certain label to a given workflow or
workflow step.</li>


<li style='margin-top:9pt'>The <b>Notes</b> column can contain any
free-form text, which will be entered into the
<a href="CreateBalancedPlan.html#taskNotes">Notes</a> column of the WBS when
the workflow is applied.  This provides a convenient shortcut when you always
wish to attach a certain note to a given workflow or workflow step.</li>


<li style='margin-top:9pt'>The <b>Script URLs</b> column allows you to
attach process scripts and other aids to the elements in a workflow.

<p>For example, you may have a web page on an organizational process
library or a team wiki that publishes instructions for a given
workflow, and provides links to helpful forms, checklists, templates,
etc. You can enter the <tt>http</tt> URL of that web page in this
column, and the page will appear in the Process Dashboard's script
menu when an individual performs the associated task.</p>

<p>You can attach URLs to an overall workflow and/or to specific
tasks within a workflow. You can enter multiple URLs for a single row;
just separate them with spaces (for example, "http://www.google.com/
http://www.yahoo.com/"). If you wish to customize the text that
appears in the dashboard's Script Menu, just put a space and the
desired text immediately after a particular URL (for example,
"http://www.google.com/ Corporate Help Desk").</p></li>

</ul>


<p>There is not a Save button on the Common Team Workflows Editor.
Instead, workflow definitions are automatically saved when you save
the main work breakdown structure. To save, switch back to the main
Work Breakdown Structure Editor window and select Save from the File
menu.</p>


<h2>High-Maturity Personal Planning</h2>

<p>As you define the steps in a workflow, two special task types are provided
in support of high-maturity personal planning.  These types are "<b>PSP
Task</b>" and "<b>Personal PROBE Task</b>."</p>

<ul>

<li>If your team is developing software, the "<b>PSP Task</b>" is an excellent
choice.  When you create a PSP task in the WBS, the task will be translated
into a PSP2.1 project in the individual's personal plan.  This gives them
access to the wealth of tools, reports, and analyses that have been developed
for the PSP process.

<p>Since a PSP Task represents all of the steps in the PSP2.1 process, you do
not need to explicitly add the PSP2.1 phases (Design, Design Review, Code,
Code Review, Compile, Test) in places where you have added a PSP Task.
However, you <u>do</u> need to add tasks for Design Inspection and Code
Inspection.  These tasks should immediately follow the PSP Task in your
workflow.  When you follow this pattern, the inspection tasks will
automatically be inserted into the correct chronological order between the
phases of the PSP Task in the individual's "Flat View" task list.</p></li>

<li>Alternatively, you can add a "<b>Personal PROBE Task</b>" to your workflow
definition.  The PROBE item creates a single task in an individual's personal
plan, with the same high-maturity planning tools as a traditional PSP
"Planning" phase.  This means that the assigned individual will be able to use
the <a href="../../help/Topics/Planning/UsingSizeEstimatingTemplate.html">Size
Estimating Template</a> and the
<a href="../../help/Topics/Planning/UsingProbeWizard.html">PROBE Wizard</a> to
refine their personal plan for this component.

<p>Unlike the "PSP Task," the "Personal PROBE Task" does not force the use
of LOC as a size measure, and it does not dictate the list of process
phases that are performed after planning.  Instead, you use the Units
column to select the appropriate size measure for the PROBE task, and you
can add any list of process phases you like to the enclosing workflow
definition.  Accordingly, the PROBE item is an excellent choice for
non-software work, and for software development workflows that diverge from
PSP2.1.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>In either case, the responsible individual will be able to draw upon their
personal historical data to refine their plan.  This provides a bridge between
<b>team</b> historical data and <b>personal</b> historical data:</p>

<ul>

<li>High-level, aggregate team data is typically used during the launch to
estimate the approximate effort that each component will require.</li>

<li>Later, when the individual is ready to begin work on a specific component,
they will create a more detailed conceptual design and use the PROBE
techniques to produce a refined estimate.</li>

</ul>

<p>This two-phased approach is an example of the "rolling wave" planning
technique, which is considered a best-practice with the project management
commmunity.</p>


<h2>Reusing Workflows via Libraries</h2>

<p>Two buttons on the toolbar provide the ability to import (<img
border=0 width=61 height=28 src="../Images/workflow-import-button.png">) and
export (<img border=0 width=61 height=28
src="../Images/workflow-export-button.png">) workflows. This makes it
possible to share workflows between projects and between project
teams. When you click one of these buttons, the workflow editor will
ask you to identify the name of a workflow library file. You can
export workflows to a new or existing library file, or import
workflows from an existing file. After choosing a file, the
Import/Export Team Workflows window will appear. This window shows the
workflows from the current project in a table on the left, and the
workflows from the library in a table on the right.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/workflow-import-export-dialog.png"></p>

<p>When exporting, you can select a workflow in the table on the left
and click the Add button to export it to the library on the
right. When importing, you can select a workflow in the library table
on the right and click the Add button to import it to the project
workflows on the left.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/workflow-import-add-example.png"></p>

<p>Workflows are identified by their names (for example, &quot;Simple
Process&quot; in the image below). If you import or export a
workflow which has the same name as an existing workflow in the
destination table, the existing workflow will be overwritten. For
example, in the image below, the user is importing workflows from an
existing library.  They have selected the &quot;Simple
Process&quot; workflow in the library on the right. Since there is
already a workflow by that name in the project workflow list on the
left, the application has automatically highlighted it, and changed
the text on the Add button to &quot;Overwrite,&quot; indicating that
if this workflow is imported it will overwrite the workflow that is
highlighted on the left.</p>

<p class="figure"><img
   src="../Images/workflow-import-overwrite-example.png"></p>

<p>At times, you may wish to import all the workflows in a library, or
export all of the workflows in your project. The Add All button will
perform this task. Keep in mind that any existing workflows with the
same names will be overwritten, as described in the paragraph
above.</p>

<p>The changes you make in the Import/Export Team Workflows window
will not be saved until you click the Import or Export button at the
bottom of the window. (Only one of these buttons will appear,
depending on whether you chose to import workflows or export
workflows.) When you click the Export button, the changes you made to
the workflow library will be saved to the named file. When you click
the Import button, the changes you made to the project workflows will
be applied to the contents of the Common Team Workflows Editor. When
importing or exporting, if you make a mistake or change your mind,
just click the Cancel button and no changes will be saved.</p>
