<h1>Creating / Customizing Process Forms and Reports</h1>

<p>The Process Dashboard contains a powerful editor for defining
custom process forms and reports. This editor makes it possible to
customize the forms for a process directly in you web browser.</p>

<p>To access this editor, you must first create a team project
according to the steps described in the <a
href="MakeTeamProject.html">Create a Team Project</a> help topic.
Then in the main Team Dashboard window, select the project from the
tree on the left, and click the first item in the list on the right to
open the team Rollup Plan Summary.</p>

<p>The Team Project Plan Summary is divided horizontally into two
panes: a navigation pane on the left, and a detail pane on the
right.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/empty-team-plan-summary.png"></p>

<p>Each pane contains an icon in the top-right corner (<img
border=0 width=14 height=14 src="../Images/icon-cms-edit.gif">)
that you can click to edit the contents.</p>

<p>While editing, you can add items to the page by clicking the <b>Add
Item</b> link at the bottom, delete items by clicking the red <b>X</b>
in their top-right corner, and rearrange items by dragging their title
bar. Many items allow you to select a list of process metrics to
display; simply type part of a metric name, and the field will show
matching metrics. If you are completely uncertain about the name of a
particular metric, just type a space into the empty text field to see
the complete list of metrics that are available for that type of
item. When you are done editing, remember to click the Save button at
the bottom of the page.</p>

<h2><a name="org"></a>Creating Forms for Organizational Use</h2>

<p>The custom forms editor makes it extremely simple for team leaders
to define the forms and reports they need to manage a project. Of
course, process mentors need access to this functionality as well, but
may not already have a team project at their disposal - particularly
when initially tailoring the dashboard for use within their
organization. As a result, process mentors will need to create a
temporary team project in their dashboard, and set it up using the
Team Project Setup Wizard, before they can use this editor. Once the
organization begins its first real project, this temporary project can
be deleted.</p>

<h2><a name="cm"></a>Configuration Management of Custom Forms</h2>

<p>The Process Dashboard does not currently perform any configuration
management of the forms created using this editor. As a result, an
organizational process mentor will almost certainly want to perform
this task on their own.</p>

<p>The definition of a custom form is saved as a single XML file. You
can find this file under the <tt>cms</tt> subdirectory of the folder
where team dashboard configuration data is stored. For example, if you
asked the installer to place team configuration data in the
<tt>T:\team\teaminstance</tt> directory, custom form definitions will be
saved in the<tt> T:\team\teaminstance\cms </tt>directory. If you cannot
recall where you asked the installer to place team configuration data,
open the Team Dashboard, choose &quot;Help&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;About
Process Dashboard,&quot; and click on the Configuration tab.</p>

<p>Currently, a particular dashboard dataset will use a single
definition of a custom form for each metrics collection framework;
this definition will be shared by all team projects within that
dashboard dataset using that metrics collection framework.</p>

<p>Custom form definitions can be copied from one dashboard dataset
to another, and shared between individuals, simply by copying the
contents of this <tt>cms</tt> directory. In particular, if a process
mentor has created forms for use by the organization, they can give
those form definitions to a project team by copying the <tt>cms</tt>
directory into that team's configuration data directory.</p>

<p>Finally, it is important to realize that the forms you create using
this tool are specific to a particular metrics collection
framework. If you create more than one custom metrics collection
framework, it will be necessary to create a plan summary form for each
one.</p>
