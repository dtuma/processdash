<h1>Managing the Team Plan</h1>


<h2><a name="reassigning"></a>Reassigning Tasks</h2>

<p>Workload balancing is an important part of team project
management. When you determine that you need to reassign tasks, take
these steps.</p>

<ol>

<li style='margin-top:6.0pt'>Select the team project in the team
dashboard, and choose Work Breakdown Structure Editor from the list
on the right.</li>

<li style='margin-top:6.0pt'>On the Team menu, turn on the Show Bottom
Up Time Panel option.  After individuals have begun collecting actual
data for the project, the colored balancing bars will update to
reflect planned time <i>remaining</i>.  You can use the colored bars
to balance the remaining work, and their end dates will roughly correspond to
the "Replan" dates in each team members earned value schedule.</li>

<li style='margin-top:6.0pt'>Switch to the Task Time tab of the Work
Breakdown Structure Editor. Edit values in the Assigned To column to
reassign the task(s) in question. Save the changes and close the Work
Breakdown Structure Editor.</li>

<li style='margin-top:6.0pt'>Any team member who was affected by the
change should take the following steps:

    <ol type=a>

    <li style='margin-top:4.0pt'>Follow the instructions in the <a
    href="CreateMemberPlans.html#syncWBS">Synchronize Work Breakdown
    Structure</a> help topic.  The synchronization logic will display
    a list of items added; review this list to ensure that the
    expected changes were made.</li>

    <li style='margin-top:4.0pt'>Open your earned value plan in the
    Task and Schedule dialog. For each newly assigned task, enter your
    best estimate of the task time remaining in the Planned Time (PT)
    column.</li>

    </ol></li>

</ol>



<h2><a name="reviewingChanges"></a>Reviewing Changes in the Team Plan</h2>

<p>Throughout the course of the project, teams will frequently refine their
plan based on newly available information.  As a result, the team plan will
change continually over time.  Reviewing and monitoring these changes is an
important part of project management and tracking, so two review methods are
provided.</p>

<p>For a quick and simple review, choose "WBS Change History Report" from the
Team Dashboard.  This will display a chronological report showing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tasks that were added, deleted, and modified</li>
<li>Task reassignments and changes to planned time</li>
</ul>

<p>You may find it useful to review the contents of this report in preparation
for your weekly team meeting, or during the meeting itself.</p>

<p>For a more detailed review of changes, open the WBS Editor and choose
"Highlight and Review Changes" from the "File" menu.  This will invite you to
select a date in the past; then it will find changes that have occurred in the
team plan since that date.  The WBS Editor will display a triangular
annotation in the top-left corner of each modified cell.  If you select one of
these annotated cells, a floating window will show you the history of how that
cell has changed over time, along with the name of the individual who made
each change.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/wbs-highlight-changes.png"></p>

<p>You can use the arrow buttons to move from one change to the next.  If you
discover something worrisome or problematic, you can click the red "X" to
bring the problem to the <a href="#dataProblems">team's attention</a>.</p>



<h2><a name="dataProblems"></a>Bringing Problems to the Team's Attention</h2>

<p>While reviewing data, you may sometimes discover problems with the plan or
with actual data.  For example, an inspection might be done but one team
member forgot to mark it complete.  Or an individual might have marked a PSP
task complete without entering any actual size data.  You can annotate these
problems by switching to the Task Details tab and entering a value in the Data
Problems column.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/wbs-data-problem.png"></p>

<p>When a note is entered into the Data Problems column:</p>

<ul>

<li>The name of the WBS item (on the left side of the window) will be
highlighted in red.</li>

<li>If you hover the mouse over the name of the WBS item, the tooltip will
display the notes that were entered into the Data Problems column.</li>

<li>If this WBS item is assigned to one or more individuals, then when those
people open the WBS Editor from their personal dashboard, rows will
automatically be expanded to make the erroneous rows visible.</li>

</ul>

<p>The presence of a note in the Data Problems column will not have any effect
on team rollups or earned value calculations.  This column is strictly a
communications tool to facilitate the job of coaches, quality managers, team
leaders, etc.  When the problem has been resolved, you can clear the error
flag by deleting the note from the Data Problems column.</p>



<h2><a name="whatIf"></a>Exploring What-if scenarios</h2>

<p>During the launch, the team creates a comprehensive plan.  But change is
inevitable, and at times you may be asked to explore the impact of a major
plan change.  For example, stakeholders might want to know the schedule impact
of a significant change in scope.  Or management might need to know the
project impact that would result from gaining or losing team members.</p>

<p>To explore these "what-if" scenarios, choose "Save a Copy" from the "File"
menu of the WBS Editor.  You can explore changes in this copy without
corrupting the real team plan.</p>

<p>For more information on this feature, see the help topic on
<a href="AlternativePlans.html">exploring alternative plans</a>.



<h2><a name="relaunch"></a>Preparing for Project Relaunch</h2>

<p>Most projects use an iterative development approach.  In the Team Dashboard,
the recommended best practice is to create a new Team Project to represent each
successive project iteration.  To assist with this task, a special "Relaunch
Wizard" is provided.</p>

<p>The team leader or planning manager should generally run the Relaunch Wizard
just before the team's project relaunch meeting.  To do this, open the Team
Dashboard, select the just-finished project from the list on the left, and choose
"File&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Alter&nbsp;Project&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Relaunch."  The
Team Project Relaunch Wizard will open in your web browser.</p>

<p>Read each page of the relaunch wizard carefully and provide the information
requested.  The relaunch wizard will:</p>

<ul>

<li>Mark the old project as <b><u>closed</u></b>, indicating that no additional
work will be performed there.</li>

<li>Create a new Team Project to hold the plan for the new iteration.</li>

<li>Copy the workflows, milestones, and team member schedules from the old plan
to the new plan.</li>

<li>Copy incomplete components and tasks from the old plan to the new plan.</li>

<li>Adjust the planned times of in-progress tasks to account for work that has
already been performed.  (For example, if a task in the old plan was estimated
to take 10 hours, and 4 hours were logged against the task in the old
iteration, the new iteration will show a planned time of 6 remaining
hours.)</li>

<li>Send invitations to all existing team members, inviting them to join the
new project iteration.  They will see the invitation when they open their
personal dashboard.  Individuals who will not be continuing into the new
project iteration will be free to decline this invitation.</li>

</ul>

<p>After the relaunch wizard finishes, each team member should:</p>

<ol>

<li>Open their personal dashboard</li>

<li>Accept or decline the invitation to join the new project iteration.</li>

<li>Perform a "sync to WBS" operation for the old project iteration.  This will
clean up their old plan so its earned value schedule is 100% complete.</li>

</ol>

<p>These actions will happen automatically for most team members.  But if a
particular individual left the project at some time in the past, you may need
to contact them and ask them to take these steps so the tasks in the their old
plan are properly closed.</p>

<p>Most teams will also like to view view end-to-end project data that spans
all of the iterations of the project.  A Master Project meets this need.  If
you are just beginning your second iteration, you should 
<a href="MakeMasterProject.html">create a Master Project</a> and
<a href="AddToMaster.html">add both project iterations</a> to this master.
If you have already been using a master project, just add the new project
iteration to the existing master project.</p>
