<h1>Optional: Create Master Project (Program Leader)</h1>

<p>In the Process Dashboard, a <b>Team Project</b> allows data to be
rolled up data from several individuals to the team level. For larger
projects, it may also be necessary to roll up data from several team
projects to the program level. <b>Master Projects</b> are designed to
meet this need.</p>

<p>To create a new master project, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>Start the Team Dashboard using the
appropriately named shortcut on the team leader's computer. The Team
Dashboard will start.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>In the Team Dashboard window, click the File
menu and choose "New Project."</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>The Team Project Setup Wizard will appear
in your web browser to walk you through the steps involved in creating
a master project.  Read each page carefully and supply the information
requested. One page of the wizard will ask whether you wish to create
a team project or a master project; choose the Master Project
option.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>At one point, the Team Project Setup Wizard
will give you an opportunity to select the directory where you would like
to store data for this master project.  By default, it will encourage you
to store data into the <a href="TeamConfigDir.html">team configuration
directory</a>.  Most teams are <b>strongly</b> encouraged to keep this
default, as it is simpler and less confusing to keep all your data in one
place.  If you have a compelling need to place <i>master project</i> data
in a separate location than <i>configuration</i> data, you can alter this
path.  However, the directory you choose <b><u>must meet</u></b> all of the
same <a href="TeamConfigDir.html#criteria">accessibility and permissions
criteria</a> as the team configuration directory.</li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>When the wizard finishes, you can close
the browser window.</li>

</ol>
