<h1>View Bottom-Up Team Plan</h1>
<b>(TSP Launch Meeting No. 6)</b>

<p>Once each team member has created their individual plan using the
steps above, you can view the consolidated team plan.</p>

<p>In the Team Dashboard, select the team project from the tree on the
left. Then select Import All Data Now from the list on the right.</p>

<p>Then return to the Team Dashboard window and select Team Project Tools
from the list on the right.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/team-scripts-tools.png"></p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/team-tools.png"></p>

<p>On that page, click the Show Status of Team Member Metrics
button. A table will be displayed, showing each team member who has
joined the project, along with the date and time when they last
exported their personal metrics.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/team-metrics-status.png"></p>

<p>Review this information carefully.  If any team member is not
listed, that person has not joined the team project.  If their
timestamp is old, they have not yet copied their tasks from the team
Work Breakdown Structure.  Communicate with team members as necessary,
and help them to resolve any problems they might be having.  To recheck
for new data, click the Refresh Data hyperlink.</p>

<p>When it appears that all team members have successfully created
their personal plans, return to the Team Dashboard and select Project
Task &amp; Schedule from the list on the right. The task list
for this project will be displayed, and should include an entry for
each member of the team.  Review this list to ensure that everything
appears correct:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>If any team member is not listed, then that person has not yet
    joined the team project.</li>

    <li>If any team member shows a PT of zero hours, then either that
    person has not yet created and exported their personal schedule by
    following the steps above, or they finished after you clicked the
    Import All Data Now button.</li>

    <li>If any team member's schedule is red and reports a &quot;task
    list missing&quot; error, it is likely that they did something
    unusual, like joining the project several times. To fix the
    problem, follow the instructions in the <a
    href="AddSchedules.html">Add Member Schedules to Team Schedule</a>
    help topic.</li>

    </ul>

<p>After working with individuals to fix any of these problems, you
must close and reopen the Task &amp; Schedule window to refresh the
data.</p>

<p>When the team is satisfied with the bottom up plan, it is a good
idea to save a baseline.  In the Task &amp; Schedule window, choose
"Tools&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Save Baseline."  This will enable your team
to see how the plan changes in the future.</p>

<p>You can view the bottom-up earned value plan for the project by
clicking the Report button on the Task and Schedule window.</p>

<p>To view the <i>entire</i> project plan, switch to the Team Dashboard
window and select the "Rollup Plan Summary" option from the list on the
right.  The rollup plan summary will appear in your Web browser.</p>

<p>This plan summary form will display the customized forms and
reports that were created earlier. For more information on the content
and customization of this form, see the <a
href="FormsReports.html">Creating / Customizing Process Forms and
Reports</a> help topic.</p>

<p>You can drill down into the subcomponents of your team plan by
clicking on the (<img src="../Images/icon-hier-nav.png">) icon.</p>
