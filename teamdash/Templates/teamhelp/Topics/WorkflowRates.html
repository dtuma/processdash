<h1>Using Workflow Rates on Older Projects</h1>

<p>In older projects, the <a href="EditWorkflows.html">workflow
editor</a> offered the option to enter productivity rates for
workflows.  That functionality became obsolete with the introduction
of <a href="PlanProjectStrategy.html#proxies">proxy estimation
tables</a>, and is no longer available for projects created with
Process Dashboard 2.6.3 and higher.  This section describes the
obsolete functionality for teams working with older projects.</p>

<h2>Entering Workflow Rates</h2>

<p>The workflow editor offers a number of 
<a href="EditWorkflows.html#advancedWorkflowColumns">advanced
columns</a> for customizing workflow behavior.  On older projects,
these include the <b>Rate</b> and <b>Units</b> columns, which can be
used to generate time estimates from size.  If you happen to know the
typical productivity rates (based on historical or estimated team
averages) for <u>all</u> the tasks in a workflow, you can enter those
rates in this column.  For example, you might wish to state that a Code
Review task takes place at a rate of 200 LOC/Hr, or that a PSP Task
completes at a rate of 20 LOC/Hr.  Here is an example for a possible
team software development process:

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/workflow-rate-example.png"></p>

<p>When you apply this workflow to a component in your team project,
the WBS Editor will look at the estimated size for the component.  It
will use that size, along with the percentages and productivity rates
you have entered, to generate an effort estimate for each task in the
component.</p>

<p>Note that that this behavior differs from the "percentage-only"
behavior that is typically used.  This is a very important
consideration.  When you examine a single team workflow, if <u>any</u>
task has a number in the Rate column, the workflow will use size
estimates to produce time/effort estimates.  If <u>no</u> rates are
present, the workflow will let you enter a top-level time estimate,
then use the percentages to spread the time across the tasks.  You
should decide which mode you wish to use for each workflow, then
either (a)&nbsp;leave the rate column blank, or (b)&nbsp;enter rates
for every task.</p>

<p>When a task in a workflow is performed by more than one person,
effort estimates will be generated differently based on the presence
of a value in the "%" column.  If you have placed a number in the "%"
column, the WBS will understand that this task is a percentage of an
overall workflow; so that percentage describes the total amount of
work that will be spread across those individuals.  If you leave the
"%" column blank and enter a Rate, the WBS will understand that each
individual is independently working at that rate.</p>

<p>An example illustrates this best.  When you examine the "Simple
Process" workflow above, three individuals will be working on the
"Code Inspection" task.  That task has been described as a task that
requires "200 LOC/Hr".  So if you apply this workflow to a component
that has 400 LOC, three people will be working on this task, and each
one will spend two hours.  In contrast, the "Integration Test" task
has been described as being 12% of a workflow that requires 10 LOC/Hr.
For a 400 LOC component, that end-to-end workflow will take 40 hours.
12% of 40 hours is 4.8 hours, so this is the total time that will be
allocated to the "Integration Test" task.  Three people are assigned,
and the time will be spread across them equally, so each one will
spend 1.6 hours.</p>

<p>The Rate column can be a useful way to produce times estimates, but
it does have a number of important limitations.  For example, it
requires the team to apply detailed workflows to "placeholder"
components in future iterations, just to answer high-level questions
about when the overall project could finish.  And it doesn't provide
flexibility for a single process to have a range of different rates
based on the complexity of a given component.  For these and other
reasons, the recommended best practice is to capture productivity
rates in <a href="PlanProjectStrategy.html#proxies">proxy estimation
tables</a>, leave the Rate column blank, and only use the percentage
column to describe the allocation of workflow time.</p>


<h2>Applying Rate-Driven Workflows</h2>

<p>To use a rate-driven workflow for planning, begin by entering a
size estimate on a WBS component:</p>

<p>When you <a href="InsertingWorkflows.html">apply the workflow</a>
to the component, your size estimate will be combined with the
workflow rates and percentages to generate planned times for each
task:</p>
