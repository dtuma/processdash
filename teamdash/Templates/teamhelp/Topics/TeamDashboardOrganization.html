<h1>Plan Team Dashboard Deployments (Process Mentor / Coach)</h1>

<p>The Team Dashboard uses a peer-to-peer approach for team and
personal planning:</p>

<ul>

<li>Every individual who installs the <b>Process Dashboard</b>
receives their own <b>personal</b> database for planning, tracking,
and improvement.</li>

<li>A group of individuals can create a <b>Team Dashboard</b> to
support <b>team</b> planning, tracking, reporting, and collaboration
for any number of <b>team projects</b>.</li>

</ul>

<p>A Team Dashboard can roll up data from many individuals to display
project reports, and an individual can be a member of many projects
(including projects from different Team Dashboards).</p>

<p>Team projects are created within a Team Dashboard. A particular
Team Dashboard can own any number of related projects. The Team
Dashboard can generate reports of rolled-up data; either from a single
project or from several related projects that it owns.</p>

<ul>

<li>If a team is performing several projects (or project iterations)
one after another, they should use a single Team Dashboard for all of
the iterations.  Doing so will allow them to view reports that roll up
data across time.</li>

<li>If several subteams will be working together closely, and those
subteams need to roll up their data into a single set of program-level
reports, they should share a single Team Dashboard.</li>

</ul>

<p>Separate Team Dashboards should be created for each logical
grouping of projects that are part of some encompassing real-world
effort.  An organization can have as many Team Dashboards as they
like.</p>

<ul>

<li>When an organization has multiple teams that are not closely
related, those teams should each have their own Team Dashboard.  It
doesn't matter if the unrelated projects share some team members; the
key question is whether leaders will need to view consolidated reports
of data rolled up from all the distinct projects.  If the answer is
no, the projects should receive separate Team Dashboards.</li>

<li>A given Team Dashboard can only see data for the projects it owns;
this helps protect data privacy and confidentiality.  In the example
diagram above, a manager who has access to Team Dashboard #1 will be
able to view reports for team projects A, B, and C; but they will not
be able to view data for project D unless they are also granted access
to Team Dashboard #2.</li>

<li>Separate Team Dashboards use less memory and generate reports more
quickly than a single, large dashboard.</li>

</ul>

<p>The coaches and process mentors in the organization should work
with new teams to decide if their projects should be added to an
existing Team Dashboard, or if creating a new Team Dashboard is more
appropriate.</p>

<p>The general steps for creating a new, distinct Team Dashboard
are:</p>

<ol>

<li>Configure a <a href="TeamConfigDir.html">data storage area</a> for
the new Team Dashboard.</li>

<li><a href="Installing.html">Run the installer</a> to create a Team
Dashboard application shortcut pointing to the new storage area.
Rename the shortcut so it has a descriptive name.</li>

<li>Open the new Team Dashboard and assign it a distinct, descriptive
name by choosing "Tools &rarr; Preferences" and editing the window
title.</li>

</ol>
