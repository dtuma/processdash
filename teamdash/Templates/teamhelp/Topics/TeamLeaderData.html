<h1>Managing Team Data</h1>


<h2><a name="importExport"></a>Importing/Exporting Data</h2>

<p>During the project, the <i>individual dashboard datasets</i>
belonging to each team member export metrics data to the shared team
directory. This exported data is then imported into the <i>team
dashboard</i> to calculate rolled up team data.</p>

<p>This export/import mechanism is generally fully automatic. The
<i>individual dashboards</i> automatically export their data each
night, and each time they are shut down. The <i>team dashboard</i>
checks for new data every ten minutes, and imports any new data it
finds. As a result, you generally will not need to interact with the
export/import mechanism.</p>

<p>At times, however, you may wish to have a team member correct a
piece of erroneous data and quickly see the change reflected in the
team rollup. At these times, you can ask the individual to select
<a href="TeamMemberDataCollab.html#export">Export My Data Now</a> from
the script menu in their personal dashboard.  Once their export is
complete, you can select Import All Data Now from the list of tools on
the right pane of the team dashboard.</p>

<p>In addition, if you are using task dependencies to coordinate work
between individuals, then you should open the team dashboard at least
once daily. This will allow the team dashboard to recompute the
completion status of dependent tasks, and communicate this data to
the individual dashboards.</p>



<h2><a name="backups"></a>Backing Up Project Data</h2>

<p>Over the course of the project, you should periodically save a backup of
the data in the Team Dashboard (saving a backup each week is recommended).
Just choose File&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Save Data Backup from the main Team
Dashboard window.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/team-save-data-backup.png"></p>

<p>The data backup will contain data for all of the projects in this Team
Dashboard, so it isn't necessary to save separate backups for each project.
If you retain these backups, you can open them later in the Quick Launcher to
see a historical view of project progress.</p>



<h2><a name="quickLauncher"></a>Using the Quick Launcher</h2>

<p>When you install the Process Dashboard, it creates a shortcut that
opens your own personal dashboard dataset (and possibly a second
shortcut to open the team dashboard).  Sometimes, however, you need to
look at data from a different dashboard. For example, the quality
manager may need to look at data collected by a single individual, or
the team coach may need to view the team plan from a remote
location. The Quick Launcher makes this possible. If you select the
Tools for Team Leaders option during installation, a Process Dashboard
Quick Launcher shortcut will be created for your use.</p>

<p>Individuals can create data backup files by opening their personal
dashboard and choosing
&quot;<img src="../Images/cmenu.png">&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Tools&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Save
Data Backup.&quot;  In the Team Dashboard, this option appears on the File menu.
You can drag-and-drop one of these data backup files onto the Quick
Launcher window, and a team or personal dashboard window will open,
displaying the data exactly as it appeared when the backup was made.</p>

<p>If you do not have a Quick Launcher shortcut, you can open a data backup
by choosing &quot;<img src="../Images/cmenu.png">&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Tools&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Open Dataset&quot;
from a personal dashboard, or by choosing "File&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Open Dataset" from
a Team Dashboard.  Then select the data backup file you would like to
open.</p>
