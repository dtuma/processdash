<h1>Define Top-Down Tasks for Master Project (Program Leader)</h1>

<p>In any project of significant size, it is important for plans to be
well-organized. If this is true for a team project, it is especially
true for a master project.</p>

<p>Projects typically use a hierarchical work breakdown structure to
describe groupings of related work. At the master project level, such
a hierarchy should describe the major systems and subsystems that make
up the master project. Special attention should be given to
hierarchical systems and subsystems that are common across the team
projects.</p>

<p>If there are certain project components and/or tasks that are
common across the subprojects of a master project, you can define
these tasks in the master project. Defining these common items can
help earned value data and metrics data to roll up from subprojects to
the master project in a more meaningful way. To define these common
systems, subsystems, and tasks, follow the steps below:</p>

<ol>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>If the Team Dashboard is not already
running, start it using the appropriately named shortcut on the team
leader's computer. </li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>In the Team Dashboard window, select the
appropriate master project from the tree on the left.

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/master-scripts-top-down-wbs.png"></p></li>


<li style='margin-top:6.0pt'>Next, select Top-Down Work Breakdown
Structure from the list on the right.</li>

</ol>


<p>This will open a Work Breakdown Structure Editor where you can
enter and edit components that are common to all of the team projects
in the master project. (For more information about editing this work
breakdown structure, see the <a href="EditingTheWBS.html">Editing the
Work Breakdown Structure</a> help topic.)</p>
