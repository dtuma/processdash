<h1>Tracking Project Progress</h1>


<h2><a name="pps"></a>Project Plan Summary</h2>

<p>The Team Project Plan Summary is a very useful tool for tracking team
progress.  You can open the team plan summary by opening the Team
Dashboard, selecting your team project, and choosing the "Rollup Plan
Summary" option from the list on the right. The Team Rollup Plan Summary
contains earned value reports for the project, quality reports and charts,
and reports of overall project metrics.</p>

<p>The Team Rollup Plan Summary can be very helpful in weekly team
meetings.  There are two easy ways to view the reports during that meeting.
First, you can <a href="Installing.html">install</a> the Team Dashboard on
a laptop computer, take that computer into the conference room for your
meeting, and open the various rollup reports.  Or, you can install the
Quick Launcher on a computer in the conference room, bring in a <a
href="SaveLaunchSnapshot.html">data backup</a> that you've saved from your
Team Dashboard, and open that data backup in the Quick Launcher.</p>

<p>Also, remember that the Project Plan Summary is editable.  If you
don't find a particular metric or chart on your report, put the report
into editing mode and add it.  If you don't find the metric you're
looking for in the list of provided items, please contact the Process
Dashboard development team.  We're always open to suggestions on how
to make the dashboard better!</p>



<h2><a name="ev"></a>Earned Value Reports</h2>

<p>The Team Rollup Plan Summary includes earned value reports for the
project. These reports roll up the individual earned value plans owned
by each team member into a single earned value plan for the entire
team.</p>

<p>Near the top of the team earned value report, you will find a
<i>Show Weekly View</i> hyperlink. Clicking this hyperlink will
display a chronological cross section of the project schedule that
summarizes the accomplishments of the previous week and lists the
tasks scheduled to be completed in the coming week. This is very
useful in the weekly team meeting. For monitoring and status reporting
on longer projects, a monthly view is also available.</p>

<p>Once the team has collected a minimum amount of earned value data,
these earned value reports will include forecasts for overall project
cost and completion date. You will notice that the team earned value
plan typically includes two different forecasts for the project
completion date.</p>

<ul>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'><b>Forecast Completion Date</b> is the
date the project is forecast to finish if no tasks are reassigned. If
the workload becomes unbalanced and tasks are not reassigned, then
some team members will finish earlier than others. Accordingly,
Forecast Completion Date is calculated by looking at each team
member's schedule and identifying the date the last person is
projected to finish. </li>

<li style='margin-top:12.0pt'><b>Optimized Forecast Completion
Date</b> is the date the project is forecast to finish if tasks are
rebalanced optimally. If you were able to reassign work perfectly so
every team member finished at the same time, the project might
complete on the calculated date.</li>

</ul>

<p>Practically speaking, it is rarely possible to keep the workload
perfectly balanced, so a realistic forecast completion date would fall
between the two dates provided above. When the two forecast dates
differ significantly, the project workload is unbalanced and tasks
likely need to be reassigned.</p>

<p>At times, you may need to drill down into the earned value schedule
for a particular team member.  To do this, open Team Dashboard window
and select Task and Schedule from the File menu. Open the schedule for
the team project. If you highlight the sub-schedule for a particular
individual, you can choose "Filtered Chart" or "Filtered Report" from
the "View" menu to see graphical, statistical, and printable views of
that individual's earned value plan.</p>



<h2><a name="scanner"></a>Project Data Scanner</h2>

<p>High-maturity project teams collect a lot of data.  This data can be very
valuable for project tracking, analysis, and process improvement; but at
times, the sheer volume of data can be difficult to sift through.  The Project
Data Scanner report aims to help with this task.</p>

<p>The Project Data Scanner report analyzes team project data to look for
common problems and highlight opportunties for improvement.  Coaches, team
leaders, and quality coordinators can use this report to gain insight into the
project and to identify data problems.</p>

<p>When the Project Data Scanner report identifies potential data problems, it
displays them in a list for review.  The coach, team leader or quality manager
can look over these lists periodically.  When a particular finding has been
reviewed and handled, the responsible individual can mark the checkbox on that
line to clear the item from the report.</p>

<p>In the current release of the dashboard, the Project Data Scanner report
includes several useful analyses; but many more are possible.  If you have an
idea for a new process data check, send a suggestion to the Process Dashboard
development team so it can be added in a future release.</p>



<h2><a name="labelFiltering"></a>Analyzing Filtered Data Using Labels</h2>

<p>Although the project planning summary allows you to drill down into
subcomponents in your team plan, sometimes you will have a need to
analyze a subset of data that slices across those hierarchical
boundaries. To support this need, the dashboard has a powerful feature
for analyzing arbitrary subsets of team data based on keywords called
&quot;labels.&quot;</p>

<p>Labels can be associated with tasks using the Work Breakdown
Structure editor. During the team launch, you may not wish to spend
the entire team's time entering these labels. But after the launch is
complete, you might want to open the WBS and attach keywords to
various tasks. This can be done by entering values in the &quot;Task
Labels&quot; column on the &quot;Task Details&quot; tab. Each task can
have any number of labels, separated by commas or spaces. Tasks will
inherit the labels of their WBS parent unless you request
otherwise.</p>

<p>If you use labels extensively, you may find that the Labels column becomes
cluttered with keywords for many different categories.  In this case, it is
wise to create <a href="EditingWBSMetrics.html#customColumns">custom
columns</a> for each independent categorization.  As you define the custom
column, check the box to "Show values as labels in team reports."  This will
allow you to filter team charts and reports based on the values in the column.
When you use this approach, the Labels column can be used primarily for
one-off keywords.</p>

<p>After you edit labels and save the Work Breakdown Structure, you
can apply a label filter from any page of your Team Project Plan
Summary. To apply a label filter, click the filter icon that appears
at the top of the plan summary page (<img
src="../Images/icon-filter.png">). A form will be displayed, prompting
you for the label filter expression you wish to use. The syntax of
this expression is similar to familiar search engines like Google; the
form includes an explanation of the syntax.</p>

<p>When you apply the label filter, all the metrics you see in your customized
forms, charts, and reports will be filtered to include only the tasks that
match your filter expression.  In addition to the labels that you enter in the
WBS, the filter expression can also include:</p>

<ul>

<li>The names of milestones, to select only the tasks associated with a given
milestone.</li>

<li>The special word "Completed_Tasks" will only include data from tasks that
have been marked complete. (Putting a "<tt>-</tt>" character in front will
select the incomplete tasks.)</li>

<li>The special word "Completed_Components" will only include data from WBS
components which are 100% complete.</li>

</ul>



<h2><a name="groupFiltering"></a>Analyzing Filtered Data Using Groups</h2>

<p>The people collaborating on a project can often be categorized in various
ways.  For example, you might have:</p>

<ul>

<li>people from different reporting units within the organization</li>

<li>people of different engineering disciplines, such as analysts, developers
and QA</li>

<li>different subteams within a project, each focused on a different area</li>

</ul>

<p>The Team Dashboard allows you to define arbitrary groups to describe these
collections of people.  To do this, choose "Edit Groups" from the "Tools"
menu.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/team-tools-groups.png"></p>

<p>The group editor will appear, allowing you to add, copy, rename, and
delete groups.  If you highlight the name of a group on the left, you can
select the individuals who should be included in the group on the right.  The
names on the right side are taken from the list of people who have 
<a href="InviteJoin.html">joined projects</a> in this Team Dashboard.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/team-edit-groups.png"></p>

<p>Once groups have been defined, you can filter your view of the Team
Dashboard to show data pertaining to a given group.  Just click the group
selector that appears in the top right corner of the main Team Dashboard
window.  The tree will narrow to show projects that the given individuals are
participating in.  To remove the filter, click the group selector and choose
"Everyone" (the default initial value).</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/team-scripts.png"></p>

<p>After you select a group, that filter will be inherited by other windows
and reports that you open.  For example, if you open the Project Task &amp;
Schedule window, it will only show earned value data from people in the
selected group.  And if you open a report like the <a href="#pps">Project Plan
Summary</a>, the sums will only show data from people in the selected group.
You can change the active filter dynamically by clicking the group selector at
the top of a particular window or report.  This can be extremely useful as a
way to monitor project progress for a particular subteam, reporting unit,
etc.</p>

<p>Group filters should not be used to view data for a single individual,
since that would be a violation of TSP data privacy ethics.  Accordingly, the
Team Dashboard reports perform a check to see whether a given group filter
would predominately display data for a single individual.  If so, the data in
the report will be censored to protect that individual's data privacy.</p>
