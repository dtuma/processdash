<h1>Create Individual Team Member Plans</h1>
<b>(TSP Launch Meeting No. 6)</b>

<p>Once the team plan is created and balanced, you can copy the data
in this plan to create plans for each team member. For simplicity, it
is best to wait until the team is satisfied with the balanced plan
before proceeding to this step. The team leader should save the work
breakdown structure (using the Save option on the File menu of the
Work Breakdown Structure Editor), and then have each team member
perform the steps below. (If any project tasks were assigned to the
team leader, then the team leader should perform the steps below as
well.)</p>

<p>Before an individual can follow the instructions below, they must have
already <a href="Installing.html">installed the Process Dashboard</a> and
<a href="MembersJoin.html">joined the team project</a>. If a particular
team member has not yet performed these steps, they must accomplish them
first before they can follow the steps below.</p>


<h2><a name="syncWBS"></a>Synchronize Work Breakdown Structure</h2>

<p>If your team is using <a href="TeamConfigDirCloud.html">cloud
storage</a> for team data, make sure your cloud provider's sync client
is running and active.  The sync client needs to copy the latest WBS
data from the cloud before you can ask the Process Dashboard to sync
those changes into your personal plan.</p>

<p>On your personal computer, start the Process Dashboard. Use the
hierarchy menus to navigate to the team project. Then click the script
button and choose Sync Work Breakdown Structure.</p>

<p>Then wait while the dashboard copies data from the team plan.</p>

<h2><a name="schedule"></a>Review Planned Tasks and Schedule</h2>

<p>Return to your Process Dashboard window. From the script menu, choose
Project Task &amp; Schedule. Your personal schedule will be displayed.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/indiv-task-schedule.png"></p>

<p>The top half of this window shows a list of tasks assigned to
you. Review this list of tasks to ensure that it appears correct.</p>


<p>The bottom half of the window shows your personal schedule.  Each
row shows a particular week on the calendar.  The Planned Time (PT)
column shows the number of hours you might be able to spend on
productive project work each week.  Review this information to ensure
that it appears correct.  If any changes are necessary, make the
appropriate edits and click the Save button.  You can then close the
Task and Schedule window if you wish.</p>

<h2>Export Personal Data</h2>

<p><a name="export"></a>Finally, return to your Process Dashboard window.
Click the script button and select the Export My Data Now option.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/indiv-scripts-export.png"></p>

<p>If your team is using <a href="TeamConfigDirCloud.html">cloud
storage</a> for team data, make sure your cloud provider's sync client
is running and active.  Your data isn't fully exported until the sync
client reports that all files are published and up-to-date.</p>
