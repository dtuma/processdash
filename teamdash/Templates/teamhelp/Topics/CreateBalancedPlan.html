<h1>Develop Balanced Project Plan</h1>
<b>(TSP Launch Meeting Nos. 4 and 6)</b>

<p>Different teams use different planning styles during their project launch.
For example, some teams begin by creating an unbalanced top-down plan for the
project.  After this plan is segregated into individual plans, a second effort
is initiated to reassign work so the individual plans will be balanced.</p>

<p>In contrast, the team support for the Process Dashboard makes it possible
to perform these two tasks simultaneously. As a result, you may wish to
consider merging TSP launch meeting No. 4 and meeting No. 6 into a single
launch meeting.</p>

<h2><a name="refining"></a>Refining Project Components</h2>

<p>The first step in creating a team plan is to refine the high-level
components listed in the earlier team strategy meeting. This may
involve hierarchically subdividing plan components targeted for the
upcoming project phase or cycle.  If you did not previously have any
documents in your work breakdown structure, you may find that you wish
to add some at this point.</p>

<p>For work to be performed on legacy components, it is sometimes
helpful to use the Size Accounting tab. This tab will allow you to
enter the Base size of a legacy item, as well as estimates of the
sizes of Deleted, Modified, Added, and Reused components. In keeping
with PSP guidance, the New and Changed size (N&amp;C) is the size that
matters for cost planning purposes, so the value in that column is the
size metric that will be displayed on other tabs.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/wbs-size-accounting.png"></p>

<p>Using the Size Accounting tab is completely optional; use it only if
you find it helpful for the planning of a particular item. Many teams
find size accounting an unnecessary distraction during a high-level
team planning session like a project launch; size metrics can be
entered directly on the Size tab instead.</p>


<h2><a name="tasks"></a>Creating, Estimating, and Assigning Tasks</h2>

<p>Once the components are refined to the team's satisfaction, the
team is ready to plan the tasks involved in performing the work. The
simplest way to accomplish this is to apply the common
processes/workflows defined earlier. Simply select one or more WBS
items, then select an appropriate process/workflow from the Workflow
menu. The contents of the given workflow will be inserted as children
underneath each selected WBS item. For more information, see the <a
href="InsertingWorkflows.html">inserting workflows</a> help topic.</p>

<p>When creating tasks, you have the option of using PSP Tasks. PSP
Task items are automatically translated into PSP2.1 projects in an
individual's dashboard hierarchy. As a result, you do not need to
explicitly add the PSP2.1 phases (Design, Design Review, Code, Code
Review, Compile, Test) in places where you have added a PSP Task.</p>

<p>Of course, the PSP Task focuses on the "personal" portion of the
development lifecycle, so it does not automatically include Design
Inspection and Code Inspection tasks.  Those tasks should be entered as
separate rows that immediately follow the PSP Task.  If you follow this
pattern, the inspection tasks will automatically be inserted into the
correct order between the phases of the PSP Task in the individual's
"Flat View" task list.</p>

<p>Generally, tasks should be subdivided until they are 10 hours or
less. PSP Task elements, however, will be automatically subdivided
into phases when they are copied into an individual's schedule. Thus,
it is acceptable for PSP Tasks to be larger than 10 hours.</p>

<p>If your WBS items included sizes and your process/workflow
definitions included <a href="EditWorkflows.html#rate">productivity
rates</a>, these numbers will be used to calculate preliminary time
estimates for the tasks inserted via the process/workflow. You need
not accept these preliminary estimates. Instead, examine each task as
a team and decide whether the estimate seems reasonable, editing
values as necessary. These times are most easily viewed and edited on
the Task Time tab.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/wbs-with-time-estimates.png"></p>

<p>If your workflow definitions <a
href="EditWorkflows.html#pct">included percentages but did not include
rates</a>, your team should use engineering judgement to produce your
best estimate of the time needed for a WBS item, and enter this
estimate on the Task Time tab.  The WBS will spread your time estimate
across the tasks in the workflow according to the percentages you
entered in the Workflow editor.</p>

<p>These workflow tools make it very easy to create a large number of
tasks quickly.  Unfortunately, if teams aren't paying attention, they
can sometimes accidentally divide the work into tasks that are too
small.  If you have many tasks in your plan that are measured in
minutes rather than hours, you may be falling into this trap.  When
personal plans contain a large number of small tasks, this can
dramatically increase the amount of effort individuals must devote to
daily metrics collection activities, which can foster an inaccurate
perception that TSP requires "too much overhead."  This perception can
jeopardize your organization's chances for successful adoption of the
TSP, so coaches should watch for this planning antipattern and advise
teams to adjust their planning style.</p>


<p>For more information on editing values in the table on the right-hand
side of the screen, see the <a href="EditingWBSMetrics.html">Editing
Metrics in the Work Breakdown Structure Editor</a> help topic.</p>


<p>As you plan the work for the items in your WBS, it is helpful to
assign tasks to individuals as you go. This way, the assigned
individual can be allowed to provide their input into the time
estimate. To assign tasks to individuals, simply enter team members'
initials in the Assigned To column of the Task Time tab.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/wbs-with-assignments.png"></p>

<p>To save time, you can enter assignments and time estimates all at
once in the Assigned To column. Just enter a person's initials,
followed by the time estimate (in hours). As an example, the <i>Int
Test</i> task above could be assigned to team member <i>jh</i> and
estimated at 10 hours just by entering <i>jh 10</i> in the Assigned To
column.</p>

<p>This technique can also be used when several people are assigned to
a task, but they do not all plan to spend the same amount of
time. (This scenario is common for inspections - the author of a
product typically participates in the inspection, but due to their
different role, they will often spend more or less time than the other
participants.) Just enter the time estimate after the appropriate
person's initials. For example, if you wanted to indicate that the
individual <i>jas</i> would only be spending two hours in the Code
Inspection above, you could edit the Assigned To field to read <i>jjd,
jas(2), crw, jh</i>.</p>

<p>If you find yourself moving back and forth between the various tabs
of metrics, consider creating a custom tab to collect the metrics
columns to need.  The items on the Tabs menu make this possible.</p>


<h2><a name="balancing"></a>Keeping the Workload Balanced</h2>

<p>When creating a team project plan, it is important to ensure that
the plan is balanced.  In a balanced plan, each team member has been
assigned an equitable portion of the total work, and all team members
are projected to finish at approximately the same time. A balanced
plan helps to maximize team efficiency and productivity.</p>

<p>The Work Breakdown Structure Editor provides a useful feedback
mechanism that helps you to balance your project plan. From the Team
menu, select the Show Bottom Up Time Panel option.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/wbs-team-panel.png"></p>

<p>The Bottom Up Time Panel displays a colored bar for each team
member. The horizontal bars indicate the start date and relative
length of each team member's personal schedule.  Each bar also shows
the planned end date for each team member.  If an individual is <a
href="EditTeamMemberList.html#endDate">scheduled to leave the
project</a> before their planned completion date, a red area at the
end of their bar will indicate that they are overtasked.</p>

<p>In addition, a vertical black bar shows the <i>balanced team
completion date</i>. This is the calculated date that the project
would complete if the work is balanced optimally. This date is
also displayed on the horizontal black bar that represents the entire
team.  It is easy to balance the schedule visually, since any team
member whose bar extends to the right of the vertical black line is
over-tasked, and any team member whose bar falls short of the vertical
black line is under-tasked. For example, in the image above, Jane
Smith has been assigned more work than any other team member.</p>

<p>To resolve imbalances, reassign work from an over-tasked individual
to an under-tasked one. You can reassign all of the tasks for a
particular component by editing the "Assigned To" column at the
component level.  Just click on a set of initials and type a new
value, and all of the subtasks will be transferred to the new person.
For example, in the image above, you could edit the Assigned To value
on the "Component A" row, replacing <i>jas</i> with <i>jjd</i> and
vice versa, to have John Doe and Jane Smith swap task assignments.</p>

<p>During team planning, there will be times that you will prefer not
to see the Bottom Up Time Panel. You can alternately show and hide
this panel by selecting the Show Bottom Up Time Panel option from the
Team menu.  Or if you only need to see the balanced team duration, you
can click the icon to the left of the "Team (Balanced)" label to
collapse the team member bars.</p>

<h2><a name="details"></a>Editing Task Details</h2>

<p>On the Task Details tab, you can enter additional information
about the tasks in your plan.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/wbs-details-tab.png"></p>

<p><b>Milestones:</b> If you have entered milestones for the project,
you can use this column to associate project components and tasks with
particular milestones.  Once you do this, color-coded diamonds will
appear on the Bottom Up Time Panel to indicate when each team member
will complete their work for a given milestone, and when the team as
a whole could complete each milestone if the work was perfectly
balanced:</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/wbs-team-panel-milestones.png"></p>

<p>If you have entered a commit date for a particular milestone, that
date will be displayed as a vertical dotted line.  By comparing the
colored diamonds to this vertical line, you can determine whether team
members are overcommitted for a particular milestone.  If so, you may
need to reassign work so that each team member can finish their tasks
before the commit date.</p>

<p>When balancing milestone work, you may prefer to see a stronger visual
indicator than the colored diamonds. Select the "Use Milestone Colors" option
on the Milestones menu, and the bar segments will be recolored based on the
milestone they belong to (rather than the individual).</p>

<p>You can also highlight the work associated with a particular milestone by
holding your mouse over a colored bar for a second or two. The milestone in
question will be highlighted with animated diagonal stripes.  If you move the
mouse around, it will dynamically highlight other milestones.  You can lock
the stripes to a particular milestone by clicking on a bar segment; then
unlock by clicking on the background behind the colored bars.</p>

<p>If your team has a large number of internal milestones (for example, for
items such as "Code Complete" or "Deliver to Test"), the large number of
diamonds may make the balancing bars difficult to read.  In that case, you
can optionally hide the diamonds for certain milestones by opening the
Milestones window and checking the box in the "Hide" column as desired.</p>

<p>If a particular milestone is critical, you may wish to balance the
workload through that milestone.  Click the Milestones menu and choose
to balance work through the milestone in question.  The Bottom Up Time
Panel will recalculate, and only display tasks up through and
including the selected milestone. Each colored bar will indicate when
the team member will complete the tasks through that milestone, and
the vertical black bar will show the optimal team completion date for
that milestone.</p>


<p id="taskLabels"><b>Task Labels:</b> The Task Labels column allows you to
associate keywords with the various tasks in your WBS. If you enter keywords
in this column, the team project plan summary will allow you to filter project
metrics rollups, to include only the tasks matching a given search
expression. For more information on this filtering capability, see the <a
href="TeamLeader.html#labelFiltering">Analyzing Filtered Data Using Labels</a>
help topic.</p>


<p><b>Task Dependencies:</b> The Task Dependencies column allows you
to define dependencies between tasks. You can declare dependencies on
other tasks within your own project, or on tasks in other projects
that belong to the same master project. Just double-click on a cell in
this column to enter a list of dependencies for a particular task.</p>

<p>Task dependencies in the dashboard are used to coordinate work
between individuals, but <i>are not used to calculate critical
path</i>, and do not affect the scheduling of project tasks. These
capabilities may be added in the future. But at the current time, task
dependencies are simply a way of showing individuals the information
they need in order to coordinate with their teammates more
effectively. For more information on task dependencies, please see the
<a href="../../help/Topics/Planning/TaskScheduleDependencies.html">Task
Dependencies</a> help topic.</p>

<p id="taskNotes"><b>Notes:</b> As you create a plan and enter estimates, it
is sometimes helpful to capture contextual information about a task. For
example, you may want to capture the high-level scope for a particular work
item, the assumptions used to generate the estimates, the ticket number in
your issue tracking system, etc. Just double-click on the Notes column to
enter comments about any component or task.</p>

<p>The resulting notes will appear as tooltips over the WBS hierarchy
on the left-hand-side of the window.  In addition, the notes will be
copied into the personal plans of each team member for future
reference.</p>
