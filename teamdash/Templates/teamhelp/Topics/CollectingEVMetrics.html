<h1>Collecting Earned Value Metrics (Team Member)</h1>

<p>As you perform the tasks in your project plan, you will find earned
value to be the most important means of gauging your progress.  Earned
value can tell you if you are ahead or behind schedule, whether work
is taking more or less time than expected, and even whether you are
projected to finish on time. To calculate earned value, the dashboard
needs to know the actual amount of time you spend on each task, as
well as the date each task is completed. The dashboard makes it easy
to collect this information.</p>

<p>The instructions below provide a quick introduction to several of
the most common features you will use on a team project.  <a
href="../../help/Topics/Overview/QuickOverview.html">Much more
information</a> is available elsewhere in the online help.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/indiv-dashboard-example-annotated.png"></p>

<p>As you work, use the 
<a href="../../help/Topics/Execution/HierarchyMenus.html">active task
selector</a> on the dashboard to designate the task you are currently
performing.</p>

<p>For convenience, you can choose to work through the tasks that have been
assigned to you for this project.  Click the double-left-arrow that appears to
the left of the active task name, choose "Tasks Lists," and select the earned
value task list you're using for this team project.  Then, the active task
selector will show you the tasks you need to perform, listed in chronological
order as they appear in your task list.  (To change the chronological order of
these tasks, see the discussion of &quot;Flat View&quot; in the <a
href="ManagingPersonalSched.html#flatView">Managing Your Personal Earned Value
Schedule</a> help topic.)</p>


<p>Use the <a href="../../help/Topics/Execution/PlayPause.html">Play/Pause
button</a> to start/stop an internal timer. When you begin working,
start the timer. When you are interrupted or you stop for the day,
stop the timer.</p>

<p>There is a small down-arrow to the right of the play/pause
button. Clicking this down-arrow will display a menu of tasks to which
you have logged time recently. You can make a selection from this list
to quickly resume a recently interrupted task.</p>

<p>If you make a mistake when logging time (for example, if you forget
to start or stop the timer), you can correct the mistake with the <a
href="../../help/Topics/Execution/UsingTimeLogEditor.html">Time Log
Editor</a>. To open the Time Log Editor, choose Time Log from the
<img src="../Images/cmenu.png"> menu.</p>

<p>The task note indicator appears to the right of the hierarchy
menus.  Click this icon to read and edit notes about the components
and tasks assigned to you.  You can enter or edit notes about the
tasks in your plan, but be aware that these notes will be seen and
shared with the entire team.</p>

<p>When you select a task that has a dependency, an icon will appear
to the right of the note indicator. This icon tells you whether the
task depends upon other tasks, whether those other tasks are
completed, and much more information.  Place your mouse over the icon
for more detailed information about the dependency.  For more
information about this feature, see the <a
href="../../help/Topics/Planning/TaskScheduleDependencies.html">Task
Dependencies</a> help topic.</p>

<p>When you complete a task, <a
href="../../help/Topics/Execution/CompletionButton.html">mark it
complete</a> by checking the box at the far right hand side of the
dashboard window. If you mark a task complete by mistake, you can
clear the checkbox to mark it incomplete.</p>

<p>Checking the box will mark the current task complete as of the
current date and time. If a task was completed in the past but you
forgot to mark it complete, press the Ctrl key while you check the
box. This will display a window allowing you to select the correct
completion date.</p>
