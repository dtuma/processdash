<h1>Simultaneous Editing of the Work Breakdown Structure</h1>

<p>The Work Breakdown Structure is the focal point of the team's planning
activities, both during the launch and afterward during the project itself.
There will be times when several people may need to modify the plan at the
same time.  Accordingly, the WBS Editor will allow more than one person to
make changes simultaneously.</p>

<p>When you choose "File&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Save" to save your changes to the
Work Breakdown Structure, the application will check to see if other
individuals have recently saved changes as well.  If they have, the save
operation will merge their changes into your view.</p>

<p>If you wish to merge other people's recently saved changes into your view
without saving your own in-progress edits, choose
"File&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;Refresh Data."</p>

<p>In either case, if the merge identifies editing conflicts (where you and
another individual have made conflicting edits to the same value), warning
messages will be displayed.  These warnings include hyperlinks that help you
to locate and recover from the editing conflict.</p>
