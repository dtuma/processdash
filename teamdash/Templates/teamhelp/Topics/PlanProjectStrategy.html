<h1>Plan Overall Project Strategy</h1>
<b>(TSP Launch Meeting No. 3)</b>

<p>One of the first tasks in your project launch will be to create
your overall project strategy. The dashboard provides powerful tools
in support of this task.</p>

<p>Your project strategy begins with a conceptual design. To promote
the free flow of ideas, it is often a good idea to use a whiteboard,
easel, and other traditional meeting aids to capture the team's
ideas.</p>

<p>As the conceptual design begins to take shape, you will begin to
identify the main components / features of the product to be produced,
or the main categories of work to be performed. These items will
ultimately become the top-level entries in your project WBS. While the
team continues to capture these on a whiteboard, it is helpful to have
one person copy these into the dashboard's Work Breakdown Structure
Editor in real-time.</p>

<p>To do this, select the team project from the tree on the left side of
the Team Dashboard window, then choose "Work Breakdown Structure Editor"
from the list on the right.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/team-scripts-wbs.png"></p>

<p>The Work Breakdown Structure Editor will open.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/wbs-editor-empty.png"></p>

<p>The Work Breakdown Structure Editor displays your hierarchical work
breakdown structure (WBS) on the left. Tabs on the right hand side of
the screen provide access to various collections of project planning
metrics. During the conceptual design process, you will primarily use
the hierarchical list on the left-hand side. If you need more space to
view this hierarchical list, simply drag the <i>splitter bar</i> to
the right.</p>

<p>The WBS is displayed in outline format. To create a new item in the
WBS, just press Enter or Insert. Click on the name of an item to edit
it. To arrange items hierarchically, press Tab or Shift-Tab to change
their indentation within the outline. You will find many of these
tasks repeated on the toolbar and the Edit menu. For more in-depth
information, see the <a href="EditingTheWBS.html">Editing the Work
Breakdown Structure</a> help topic.</p>

<p>If this team project is a member of a master project, the master
project leader may have outlined a set of high-level components that
you should use as the basis for your conceptual design.  As you enter
your conceptual design into the WBS, you should align the tasks you
create underneath the appropriate high-level components from the
master project whenever it makes sense to do so.</p>

<p>Most of the items you enter during conceptual design will be
software components. These items appear in the WBS with a small floppy
disk icon (<img border=0 width=13 height=13
src="../Images/icon-floppy.png">). If your conceptual design includes
documents or tasks, you can alter the type of an item by clicking on
the icon. A menu will appear that you can use to change the WBS item
type.</p>

<p>To complete the conceptual design, the team typically produces
rough size estimates for each item in the WBS. You can enter this data
by selecting the Size tab on the right-hand side of the screen. The
sizes of software components should be estimated in lines of code
(LOC), and documents should be estimated in pages. If you have created
any tasks in your conceptual design, you can enter a size metric of
your own choosing in the Units column.</p>

<p>With rough size estimates in place, your team is ready to determine
its overall project development strategy. One component of this
strategy will be the list of items you wish to include in the upcoming
project phase or cycle. If your plan includes large software
components that will be developed over multiple iterations, you may
wish to hierarchically subdivide them to mirror this decision.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/wbs-editor-concept.png"></p>

<p>Of course, it is also important to produce a rough understanding of the
amount of effort that the project will require.  Your team may use a variety
of planning techniques (such as fuzzy logic, wide-band delphi, or PROBE) to
estimate the approximate amount of time each component will require.  In
accordance with TSP planning techniques, these should be "direct time"
estimates, corresponding with the amount of direct time per week that each
team member estimated that they would be able to spend on project work.  As
you produce these estimates, you can switch to the Task Time tab and enter
them in the Time column.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/wbs-editor-concept-time.png"></p>

<p>These rough time estimates form the basis for the team's capacity planning.
Stakeholders will be interested in knowing how long it will take to finish the
project, and when various iterative deliverables might be ready.  To see this
information, click the Team menu and select the "Show Bottom Up Time Panel"
option.  Also, look on the Team menu and ensure that the box is checked to
"Include Unassigned Effort in Balanced Team Calculation." With these settings
in place, the black horizontal "Team" bar will show the date when the team
might be able to complete all of the work for the entire project.  At this
early stage in the planning process, it is probably most helpful to hide the
colored bars for each team member by clicking the icon to the left of the
"Team (Balanced)" label.</p>


<h2><a name="proxies"></a>Using Proxies to Estimate Size and Time</h2>

<p>As described above, teams can produce estimates manually and enter them
directly on the Size and Task Time tabs.  If desired, teams can also use a
more advanced technique based on estimation proxies.</p>

<p>During high-level planning, it can often be difficult to visualize details
like the number of LOC, pages, hours, etc. that will be required for a
particular component.  The team may have more success visualizing the work in
terms of high-level concepts like "Change Requests," "User Stories," "Help
Documents," etc.  In the TSP parlance, these high-level concepts are called
"proxies."  The team can create and edit a list of proxy tables by choosing
"Edit Proxy Estimation Tables" from the Workflow menu.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/proxy-table-editor.png"></p>

<p>Each proxy table has a unique name, and is displayed with a table icon.
You can create a new proxy table by highlighting the name of an existing table
and pressing Enter or Insert.  Within each table, rows are listed for relative
sizes such as small, medium, and large.  You can create new relative size rows
by highlighting a row and pressing Enter or Insert, and you can delete
unneeded rows by pressing the delete button on the toolbar.</p>

<p>For each relative size row, you can enter a size, rate, and/or time.  All
of these columns are optional.  If the team is not worried about estimating
size, they can create a proxy table that only uses the Time column.
Similarly, the team can make use of the size column only, if they prefer to
make time estimates using a different technique.  Of course, it is possible to
enter numbers in all three columns if desired.</p>

<p>Best practices for estimation often recommend the use of a logarithmic
scale for the estimates in the relative size rows.  Accordingly, the proxy
editor will automatically fill in empty rows for you as soon as you enter one
or more size or time estimates.  For example:</p>

<ul>

<li>You could enter the size of a typical item on the "M" (medium) row, and a
standard scaling factor will be used to fill in typical estimates for the
other relative size rows.</li>

<li>If you enter estimates for at least two rows, the proxy editor will use
those numbers to calculate the scaling factor (rather than using a standard
scaling factor).  Then your scaling factor will be used to fill in the missing
estimates.</li>

<li>You are not required to accept these auto-scaled estimates; feel free to
overwrite them by entering estimates of your own choosing for each relative
size row.</li>

</ul>

<p>There is not a Save button on the Proxy Tables Editor. Instead, tables are
automatically saved when you save the main work breakdown structure. To save,
switch back to the main Work Breakdown Structure Editor window and select Save
from the File menu.</p>

<p>If you build proxy tables that are reusable across different projects or
different teams, you can use the Import and Export buttons on the toolbar of
the proxy editor window to copy tables between projects.</p>

<p>After creating these tables, the team can return to the Task Details tab on
the main WBS Editor window.  Select a proxy type and a relative size for a
particular component, and the WBS Editor will retrieve the corresponding size
and/or time estimates from your proxy table. This technique can help a team to
very quickly produce estimates for a large number of components in the Work
Breakdown Structure.</p>


<h2><a name="milestones"></a>Iterations and Milestones</h2>

<p>Most teams will also need to plan the iterative development approach for
the project.  Many decisions factor into this iteration plan, including the
prioritization of work and the relative amount of effort that can be allocated
to each cycle.  To explore these tradeofs, click the Milestones menu on the
WBS Editor window, and select Edit Milestones.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/milestones-editor.png"></p>

<p>You can enter milestones corresponding to cycles/iterations, to noteworthy
schedule events, or to external commitments.  Place the milestones in
approximate chronological order.  Each milestone should have a unique name.
Commit dates are optional.</p>

<p>Back on the WBS Editor, choose the Task Details tab and select the most
appropriate Milestone for each component.  As you do, diamonds on the
horizontal black "Team (Balanced)" bar will indicate the approximate dates
when the team could finish all of the components allocated to a particular
milestone.  As you change the milestone assignments for various components,
the diamonds will update dynamically to indicate the optimal date when each
milestone could finish.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/wbs-editor-concept-milestones.png"></p>

<p>If your capacity planning needs are complex, you may benefit from the
techniques decribed in the <a href="AlternativePlans.html">alternative
plans</a> help topic.</p>

<p>There is not a Save button on the Milestones Editor. Instead,
milestones are automatically saved when you save the main work
breakdown structure. To save, switch back to the main Work Breakdown
Structure Editor window and select Save from the File menu.</p>
