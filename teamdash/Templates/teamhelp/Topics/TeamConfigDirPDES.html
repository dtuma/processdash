<h1>Using Process Dashboard Enterprise Server for Team Data</h1>


<p>The Process Dashboard Enterprise Server was purpose-designed to
provide specialized storage for team and personal data.  It is
optimized for fast, reliable access, and eliminates many of the
challenges associated with other storage options.  To use the
Enterprise Server for an existing Team Dashboard, see the
<a href="#migrate">migration instructions</a> below.  The Enterprise
Server provides a number of benefits:</p>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>PRO:</b></td>
<td>Creation of new team and personal dashboards is fast and easy, and
team project creation/joining operations are more automated.  This
saves time and eliminates work for coaches as they onboard
<a href="TeamDashboardOrganization.html">new teams</a>, allowing them
to focus on value-added work.</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>PRO:</b></td>
<td>You can access team data from any number of different computers
(including a mix of Windows / Mac OS X / Linux computers) and diverse
networks (including geographically distributed teams and remote
workers using a VPN).</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>PRO:</b></td>
<td>Dashboard operations are not affected by the speed of your
network.  Startup and shutdown times remain consistent, even over a
slow VPN.</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>PRO:</b></td>
<td>When you need to let a coach or team leader access team reports,
you can easily grant them permissions.  This can be done by opening
the Team Dashboard and choosing "Tools &rarr; Edit Users," or by
logging in to the Enterprise Server, clicking the "Details" link for a
dataset, then clicking "Edit Permissions" on the dataset details
page.</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>PRO:</b></td>
<td>Local and remote coaches can easily access live, up-to-date team
data.  Live access makes it possible to view the WBS change history,
leave notes for the team about data problems, correct minor data
problems, and adjust labels for special analyses.</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>PRO:</b></td>
<td>Team data privacy is protected automatically, without the need to
manually configure filesystem permissions, and without the ongoing
headache of reconfiguring permissions when team membership
changes.</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>PRO:</b></td>
<td>Team data is safely backed up to the server at all times, and
won't be lost if your hard drive crashes.</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>PRO:</b></td>
<td>Existing team project data (from past and current projects) can be
easily <a href="#migrate">migrated into the server</a> with no team
downtime.</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>PRO:</b></td>
<td>You don't need to manually upgrade the Dashboard when new versions
of the software become available. The server administrator can push
software upgrades automatically.</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>PRO:</b></td>
<td>A "time machine" feature makes it possible to view reports,
charts, and data as they appeared at any point in the past.  This can
assist with postmortem analysis, data recovery, and more.  You can
view historical reports by logging in to the Enterprise Server,
clicking the "Details" link for a dataset, then clicking the
historical data link in the "Actions" section of the dataset details
page.</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>PRO:</b></td>
<td>It is possible to share process definitions, workflows, custom WBS
columns and tabs, proxy estimation tables, defect type standards, and
custom reports across the entire organization.  With the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.processdash.com/pdes-tpdw/">data
warehouse</a> option, organization-wide cross-team data analyses
become possible.</td></tr>

<h2><a name="createTeam"></a>Enterprise Server Team Dashboard
Creation</h2>

<p>The general steps for creating a new Team Dashboard on the
Enterprise Server are:</p>

<ol>

<li class="space"><a name="account"></a>Obtain an account on a Process
Dashboard Enterprise Server.

    <ul>

    <li>If many people in your organization use the Process Dashboard,
        your organization can <a target="_blank"
        href="https://www.processdash.com/pdes-pricing/">purchase a
        license</a> to run the server in-house.</li>

    <li>For personal use, or use by a small team, <a target="_blank"
        href="https://www.processdash.com/pdes-pricing/">monthly
        subscriptions</a> are available.</li>

    </ul></li>

<li class="space">Log in to the Enterprise Server in your web browser.
After successfully logging in, click "Create New Dataset" in the
navigation menu on the left side of the page.

    <ul>

    <li>If you have not been granted access to this option, contact
        the server administrator to create the team dashboard dataset
        for you.</li>

    <li>Otherwise, enter a unique name for the new team dashboard and
        click Save.</li>

    </ul></li>


<li class="space">Return to the "My Datasets" page, and click the link
to the team dashboard you just created.  This will download a small
file with instructions to launch the team dashboard.

    <ul>

    <li>Some web browsers will open this file automatically; if your
        browser does not, double-click the file to open it manually.
        Your server-based team dashboard will open.</li>

    <li>If your computer doesn't know how to open the file, click the
        link at the bottom of the "My Datasets" page to download and
        install the Process Dashboard Launcher software.  (The
        launcher installer will also create an application icon that
        you can click to open the Team Dashboard directly.)</li>

    <li>You can open this server-based Team Dashboard from as many
        other computers as you like; just follow the instructions in
        this step from another computer.</li>

    </ul></li>

</ol>



<h2><a name="migrate"></a>Migrating Existing Team Data into the
Enterprise Server</h2>

<p>Historical data is extremely valuable for team planning, tracking,
and postmortem analysis.  If you've already been using the Team
Dashboard, it's easy to migrate your existing data into the Enterprise
Server.  The general steps for migration are:</p>

<ol>

<li class="space">Obtain an account on a Process Dashboard Enterprise
Server as described <a href="#account">above</a>.</li>

<li class="space">Obtain Enterprise Server accounts for all
individuals who are active team members, leaders, or coaches of the
projects in the Team Dashboard you wish to migrate.  Ask them to log
in to the server at least once to establish their password.</li>

<li class="space">Go to a computer that has an existing icon for the
Team Dashboard you wish to migrate. If the Team Dashboard is running,
close it.</li>

<li class="space">Download the Enterprise Server
<a href="https://www.processdash.com/download_mec/pdesImport">migration
tool</a> and install it by opening/double-clicking the downloaded
file.</li>

<li class="space">Open the Team Dashboard.  Then choose "Tools &rarr;
Migrate Data to Server" and follow the prompts.</li>

<li class="space">The migration wizard will import project data into
the server, followed by core configuration data.</li>

</ol>

<p>This migration operation is mostly seamless to end users:</p>

<ul>

<li>Team leaders and coaches can continue to use their existing Team
Dashboard shortcuts; those shortcuts will automatically connect to the
server instead.</li>

<li>Team members can continue to work on the project as usual.  Their
personal dashboards will automatically connect to the server as needed
to access team project data.</li>

</ul>

<p>Typically, the only change people may notice is a new
username/password prompt from the dashboard and the WBS Editor.
Completing Step 2 above will ensure they know the right credentials to
use at that prompt.</p>
