<h1>Selecting a Metrics Collection Framework (Coach)</h1>

<p>When implementing any metrics program, an organization must decide
upon a well-defined set of process metrics that they will
collect. Without precisely-defined metrics, data collected by
individuals cannot meaningfully be consolidated and analyzed at the
team level.</p>

<p>For high-maturity processes inspired by
PSP<sup style="font-size:x-small"> (SM)</sup> and
TSP<sup style="font-size:x-small"> (SM)</sup>, these definitions
include:</p>

<ul>

<li>The size metrics that will be used estimate and measure product
size</li>

<li>The process phases that will be used to characterize defect
injection and removal</li>

</ul>


<p>It can be challenging to identify these on a new project, so the
Process Dashboard provides <b>metrics collection frameworks</b>, which
offer a core set of default phases and metrics.  Three different
frameworks are provided based on the type of work your team is
performing:</p>

<ul>

<li style="margin-bottom:8px">The <b>Universal</b> framework is an
excellent choice for any team.  It offers a simple set of phases that
are intuitive and broadly applicable for many types of work, along
with a small set of commonly used size metrics.</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:8px">The <b>Team Software
Process<sup style="font-size:x-small"> (SM)</sup></b> framework is
useful if your team is primarily writing software.  It provides a
thoughtful set of phases and metrics that capture software development
best practices.</li>

<li>The <b>Software Systems Development</b> framework provides a more
complex set of phases that encompass hardware and software
engineering.  Teams that perform software-intensive systems
development may find it useful to guide their planning efforts.</li>

</ul>

<p>The dashboard has historically allowed organizations to create
their own custom frameworks, so you may see additional options to
choose from when you create a project.  But the need for custom
frameworks has diminished over time with the addition of support for
<a href="PlanProjectStrategy.html#sizeMetrics">custom size metrics</a>
and <a href="TeamLeaderProcess.html#toDate">workflow process
analysis</a>.</p>
