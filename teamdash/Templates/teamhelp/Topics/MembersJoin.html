<h1>Join Team Project (Team Members)</h1>

<p>As an individual, your personal historical data is very useful for
planning, tracking, and personal process improvement.  So the dashboard
strives to let you keep all of your personal historical data in one place.
You can use a single Process Dashboard dataset to collect all of your personal
data, even if you move from team to team and work on many different projects
over time.  Because of this flexibility, you must tell the dashboard when you
are joining a new team project.</p>

<p>Before you can join the project, you must have successfully
installed the Process Dashboard. Start the Process Dashboard and leave
it running.</p>

<p>Your team leader will send you a special URL or file that you can use to
join the team project.  If they send a URL, open it in a Web browser.  If they
send a file, drag and drop it onto your Process Dashboard window.</p>

<p>If your team leader sends you a URL, but you get an error message like
"Server not found" or "This page cannot be displayed" when you attempt to
visit this page, contact your team leader and ask for help.  They may send
you a "joining file" instead.</p>

<p>When the Team Project Setup Wizard appears successfully, it will display a
form to collect information about the project.  Fields with a white background
need your attention, but you can accept the default values that appear in the
gray fields.  As you click on each field, explanations will appear to help you
understand what you should enter.</p>

<p>One of the fields will ask you for your initials.  The value you enter here
should match the initials that are entered for you in this project's
<a href="EditTeamMemberList.html">team member list</a>, so your team leader
may tell you which initials you should use.  As you type, autocompletion will
show you matches from the current team list; you can select your name from
those autocompletion options if you see it.  If you enter the wrong initials
during this step, do not worry; you can easily fix them later by opening the
Project Parameters and Settings page for this team project.</p>

<p>When the wizard finishes, you can close the browser window.</p>
