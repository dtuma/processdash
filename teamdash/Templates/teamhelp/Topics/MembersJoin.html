<h1>Join Team Project (Team Members)</h1>

<p>As an individual, your personal historical data is very useful for
planning, tracking, and personal process improvement.  So the dashboard
strives to let you keep all of your personal historical data in one place.
You can use a single Process Dashboard dataset to collect all of your personal
data, even if you move from team to team and work on many different projects
over time.  Because of this flexibility, you must tell the dashboard when you
are joining a new team project.</p>

<p>Before you can join the project, you must have successfully
installed the Process Dashboard. Start the Process Dashboard and leave
it running.</p>

<p>If your team is using cloud storage for team data, review and
complete the <a href="TeamConfigDirCloud.html#memberSetup">cloud
storage team member setup</a> steps.</p>

<p>Then start the joining process by following one of these steps:</p>

<ul>

<li>If your personal dashboard is hosted by the
<a href="../../help/Topics/AdvancedTopics/PersonalDataStorageOptions.html#pdes">Enterprise
Server</a>, it will display a notification that you've been invited to
join a team project.  Double-click the notification to act upon
it.</li>

<li>If your team leader sends you a joining file, drag and drop it
onto your Process Dashboard window.</li>

<li>If your team leader sends you a joining URL, open it in a web
browser.  If this results in an error message, ask your team leader to
send you a "joining file" instead.</li>

</ul>

<p>The Team Project Setup Wizard will be displayed in your web
browser.</p>

<p>Click &quot;Next,&quot; and the Team Project Setup Wizard will display a
form to collect information about the project.  Fields with a white background
need your attention, but you can accept the default values that appear in the
gray fields.  As you click on each field, explanations will appear to help you
understand what you should enter.</p>

<p>One of the fields will ask you for your initials.  The value you enter here
should match the initials that are entered for you in this project's
<a href="EditTeamMemberList.html">team member list</a>, so your team leader
may tell you which initials you should use.  As you type, autocompletion will
show you matches from the current team list; you can select your name from
those autocompletion options if you see it.  If you enter the wrong initials
during this step, do not worry; you can easily fix them later by opening the
Project Parameters and Settings page for this team project.</p>

<p>When the wizard finishes, you can close the browser window.</p>
