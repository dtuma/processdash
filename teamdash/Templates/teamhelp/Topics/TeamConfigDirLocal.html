<h1>Create Team Configuration Directory (Team Leader)</h1>

<p>The open-source bundle of the Process Dashboard currently uses a shared
network directory to facilitate team collaboration.  When a particular team
begins using the Team Dashboard for the first time, it will be necessary to
create a network directory for them to use.  (If this is difficult in your
organization, <a href="#pdes">see below</a> for other options.)</p>

<p>This <i>team configuration directory</i> will contain important team
planning information, such as the list of all the project iterations the team
has performed.  In the typical configuration, this directory will also hold
exported snapshots of individual data, which the Team Dashboard will import
and use to compute team roll-ups.</p>

<p>This team configuration directory must be accessible, readable, and
writable by all team members.  Because of this, it should generally be a
shared network directory. Since the directory will typically hold PSP data
collected by individuals, you may wish to configure it with permissions that
forbid file access by non-team members.</p>

<p>If you have several subteams that will be working together closely, and
those subteams need to roll up their data into a single set of reports, you
should create a single directory that all of these subteams will share.  If
you have multiple teams that are not closely related and who will not be
viewing consolidated reports, those teams should each have their own
directory.</p>

<p>If your team is performing several projects (or project iterations) one
after another, you should use a single team configuration directory for all of
the iterations.</p>

<p>Some projects will already have a shared network directory that is
used to hold project documents. If this is true for your project,
simply create a subdirectory for dashboard metrics data.  If your
project does not already have a shared project directory, work with
your information technology (IT) support staff to create one.</p>

<p><a name="criteria"></a>For this directory, it is <b><u>critical</u></b> to
ensure that the following file permissions are in place:</p>

<ul>

<li>All team members must be able to read/write all files</li>

<li>Permissions must be set to "inherit" - so that when new files and
subdirectories are created, all team members can read/write them as
well.</li>

</ul>

<p>If the members of your team are predominately using the Microsoft
Windows operating system, the use of a UNC path is strongly
recommended for configuration purposes.  That is, whenever the
dashboard asks for the location of this directory, you are encouraged
to enter the directory path as <tt>\\serverName\path\to\directory</tt>
instead of <tt>T:\path\to\directory</tt>.</p>

<p>Also, the Team Dashboard must be able to read and write directly to the
files in this directory.  <b style="color: a00">Do not</b> make use of
"Offline Folders," "Windows Sync," "Dropbox," "Google Drive," or any other
similar utilities which create a shadow copy of the files out on the network.
Use of those utilities will introduce a <b style="color: a00">high probability
of catastrophic loss</b> of Team Dashboard data.</p>

<p>There will be times in the future that you will need to recall the
location of the team configuration directory (for example, if a new
individual needs to install a Team Dashboard shortcut).  If you forget this
location, you can look it up by opening the Team Dashboard, choosing
Help&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;About Process Dashboard, and clicking the Configuration
tab.  The first paragraph on the Configuration tab will provide the location
of the team configuration directory.</p>

<h2><a name="pdes"></a>Alternative: Process Dashboard Enterprise Server</h2>

<p>As stated above, the open-source bundle of the Process Dashboard uses a
shared network directory to facilitate team collaboration.  That approach was
selected because it makes use of simple network services that are commonly
available in the vast majority of organizations. However, it is not a perfect
fit for every organization:</p>

<ul>

<li style="margin-bottom:12px">Some organizations do not have shared file
servers in use, or their system administrators are reluctant to create
them.</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:12px">When a team is comprised of members in multiple
locations, there may not be a network file server that all team members can
access.  And even when a particular server is reachable by the entire team,
some individuals may encounter problems stemming from network latency or poor
connectivity.</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:12px">When teams are using a mix of Windows, Mac,
Unix, and/or Linux, there is not a universal way to type the network path that
is meaningful to all of the operating systems.  In addition, "mount" commands
on Mac/Unix/Linux may have to be hand-tweaked on each computer to ensure that
file locking protocols work correctly.  These problems make initial setup
challenging for some team members.</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:12px">Finding an appropriate server, creating a new
team directory, and properly adjusting the permissions can take time.  If a
team forgets to perform these steps in advance, their initial project launch
may be needlessly delayed while the entire team waits for these tasks to
finish.</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:12px">It can be a challenge to manage filesystem
permissions based on changing team membership.  Mistakes in the configuration
of permission inheritance can sometimes go undetected and cause problems
later.</li>

<li>In a large organization with a sizeable process improvement initiative,
many teams may be using the Process Dashboard.  It can be labor-intensive to
create network directories for each team and help them to overcome the
problems listed above.  Even worse, the organization's valuable process
improvement data is then scattered across an unknown number of network
locations.  This makes it harder for coaches to work with multiple teams;
makes it challenging to ensure that proper backups are taking place; and makes
it difficult to perform any sort of organization-wide data analysis.</li>

</ul>

<p>Fortunately, the <a href="http://www.processdash.com/pdes"
target="_blank">Process Dashboard Enterprise Server</a> solves all of these
problems.  In addition, it provides teams and organizations with many
significant new benefits.  (For example, it offers the option to look back in
time and see reports, charts, and data as they appeared at some point in the
past.)  For more information on the server, visit:</p>
