<h1>Using a Network Directory for Team Data</h1>

<table border=0><tr>

<td><img width=60 height=24 src="../Images/finger.png"></td>

<td><b>Important Note:</b> In the past, Team Dashboard users were
instructed to create a shared network directory (described below) for
team data storage.  But in the current version of the dashboard, the
best practices are now to use
<a href="TeamConfigDirCloud.html">cloud storage</a> or the
<a href="TeamConfigDirPDES.html">Process Dashboard Enterprise
Server</a>.  Network directories are still allowed to support teams who
have been using the dashboard for years; but new teams should consider
the other options instead.  Migration support is also available for
teams who wish to move away from network directories; see the
<a href="TeamConfigDirCloud.html#migrate">cloud</a> and
<a href="TeamConfigDirPDES.html#migrate">server</a> topics for more
information.</td>

<p>Network directories are <b><u>not</u></b> the preferred location
for team data storage.  Here are some of the tradeoffs of this
approach:</p>

<table style="margin-left:20px; margin-top: 15px;
              border-spacing:5px 10px; border-collapse:separate">

<tr valign="top"><td><b>PRO:</b></td>
<td>This approach is based on simple file-sharing services that have
been around for decades.  This makes it an option in nearly every
environment, including air-gapped networks where other approaches
would be impossible.</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>CON:</b></td>
<td>Network file servers are a 1990's style technology that many IT
departments are reluctant to support.  With the modern preference
toward zero-trust architectures, many organizations are eliminating
their network file servers completely.</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>CON:</b></td>
<td>Project data can only be accessed data when your computer is
connected to the same network as the network file server, either
directly or through a VPN.  When a team is comprised of members in multiple
locations, there may not be a network file server that all team members can
access.  And even when a particular server is reachable by the entire team,
some individuals may encounter problems stemming from network latency or poor
connectivity.</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>CON:</b></td>
<td>File sharing protocols often have very slow performance -
especially over a VPN.  If your network is slow, it can take an
exceptionally long time for the team dashboard to open or shut down.
If your network is unreliable, it may result in data loss if the
network becomes unavailable when an individual needs to save
changes.</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>CON:</b></td>
<td>The network folder must be mapped/mounted on all the computers you
use. These connections can time out and may need to be reestablished
manually (especially after changes in network connectivity).</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>CON:</b></td>
<td>File permissions can be tricky to configure.  If file permissions
are incorrect, or if permission inheritance is not configured
properly, team members may see read-only error message in the
dashboard or WBS Editor.</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>CON:</b></td>
<td>It can be a challenge to manage filesystem permissions based on
changing team membership.  Mistakes in the configuration of permission
inheritance can sometimes go undetected and cause problems
later.</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>CON:</b></td>
<td>When teams are using a mix of Windows, Mac, Unix, and/or Linux,
individuals may encounter hard-to-overcome problems stemming from the
operating systems' differing support for file-sharing protocols.
(This can manifest itself as a startup error stating that the
dashboard or WBS was unable to lock files for writing.)</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>CON:</b></td>
<td>Finding an appropriate server, creating a new
team directory, and properly adjusting the permissions can take time.  If a
team forgets to perform these steps in advance, their initial project launch
may be needlessly delayed while the entire team waits for these tasks to
finish.</td></tr>


<tr valign="top"><td><b>CON:</b></td>
<td>In a large organization with a sizeable process improvement initiative,
many teams may be using the Process Dashboard.  It can be labor-intensive to
create network directories for each team and help them to overcome the
problems listed above.  Even worse, the organization's valuable process
improvement data is then scattered across an unknown number of network
locations.  This makes it harder for coaches to work with multiple teams;
makes it challenging to ensure that proper backups are taking place; and makes
it difficult to perform any sort of organization-wide data analysis.</td></tr>

<h2><a name="createTeam"></a>Network Directory Team Dashboard
Creation</h2>

<p>If <a href="TeamConfigDir.html">other options</a> are not
available, teams can use a shared network directory for team data
storage.  The general setup steps are:</p>

<ol>

<li class="space">Work with your information technology (IT) support
staff to identify a network file server.<ul>

    <li>This server must be on a network that is reachable by all team
        members.  For remote workers and geographically distributed
        teams, this may require use of a VPN.</li>

    <li>Team data is valuable and difficult to replace, so backups are
        important.  Work with the IT staff to make sure periodic
        backups are enabled for the server in question, and for the
        directory created in the next step.</li>

    </ul></li>

<li class="space">Create a new, empty directory on that file server.
For this directory, it is <b><u>critical</u></b> to ensure that the
following file permissions are in place:<ul>

    <li>All team members are able to read/write all files.</li>

    <li>Permissions are set to "inherit" - so that when new files and
        subdirectories are created, all team members can read/write
        them as well.</li>

    <li>Since the directory will typically hold personal data
        collected by individuals, you may wish to configure it with
        permissions that forbid file access by non-team members.</li>

    </ul></li>

<li class="space">Map or mount the network directory so it is visible
to your local computer (for example, as a new lettered drive in
Windows, or as a folder under Volumes in Mac OS X).</li>

<li class="space">When <a href="Installing.html">installing</a> the
Process Dashboard, choose the "Tools for Team Leaders" option.  When
the installer asks for the location of team configuration data, enter
the path to this directory.<ul>

    <li>If the members of your team are predominately using the
        Microsoft Windows operating system, the use of a UNC path is
        strongly recommended for configuration purposes.  That is,
        whenever the dashboard asks for the location of this
        directory, you are encouraged to enter the directory path
        as <tt>\\serverName\path\to\directory</tt> instead
        of <tt>T:\path\to\directory</tt>.</li>

    <li>The installer will create a Team Dashboard shortcut icon.  If
        you expect to access more than one Team Dashboard as part of
        your work, give that newly created icon a unique name.</li>

    </ul></li>

</ol>

<p>There will be times in the future that you will need to recall the
location of the team configuration directory (for example, if a new
individual needs to install a Team Dashboard shortcut).  If you forget this
location, you can look it up by opening the Team Dashboard, choosing
Help&nbsp;&#8594;&nbsp;About Process Dashboard, and clicking the Configuration
tab.  The first paragraph on the Configuration tab will provide the location
of the team configuration directory.</p>
