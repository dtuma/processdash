<h1>Inserting Common Team Workflows</h1>

In the Work Breakdown Structure Editor, you can quickly add the
contents of a process/workflow that you previously defined in the
Common Team Workflows Editor. Simply select a target WBS item, and
then select the desired workflow from the Workflow menu. The contents
of the selected workflow will be added as children of the selected
target WBS item. For example, suppose you have the following defined
process:

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/workflow-rate-example.png"></p>

<p>and the following WBS:</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/workflow-insert-example-before.png"></p>

<p>If you were to highlight Component B and choose Simple Process
from the Workflow menu, it would produce the following WBS:</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/workflow-insert-example-after.png"></p>

<p>If you make a mistake (for example, inserting the workflow under
the wrong WBS item), you can always undo it using the undo button
(<img src="../Images/icon-undo.png">).</p>

<p><a name="copiesOnly"></a>It is important to note that the items
inserted into your WBS via
this method are <i>copies</i> of the items in the defined process or
workflow. As a result, you can freely edit the inserted items (for
example, deleting steps that are unnecessary for the current
situation) without affecting the process/workflow definition. This
also means, however, that if you use the Common Team Workflows Editor
to alter the definition of a process/workflow later, those changes
will not be propagated into the team's WBS. For example, if you were
to open the Common Team Workflows Editor and delete the Planning step
from the definition of the "Simple Process" workflow, that change
would not affect the list of tasks under Component B. It would
continue to include a Planning step.</p>
