<h1>Managing Process Metrics (Team Member)</h1>

<p>The Process Dashboard performs many calculations that help you
track your progress and monitor the quality of the products you and
your team produce. To calculate these metrics, the dashboard needs you
to collect and enter some additional data.</p>

<h2><a name="defects"></a>Entering Defects</h2>

<p>As you create documents, designs, and code, you should keep track
of the defects you discover and remove from the software. To enter a
defect, switch to the Process Dashboard window, use the Hierarchy
Menus to navigate to the component containing the defect, and click
the <a href="../../help/Topics/Execution/EnteringDefects.html">Defect
button</a> (<img src="../Images/icon-defect.png">). A defect dialog
will appear, allowing you to describe the defect. A timer in the
defect dialog makes it possible to track the amount of time it takes
to fix the defect.</p>

<p><b>Reviews:</b> If you find defects while personally reviewing a
product that you created, enter the defect normally using the defect
dialog, as described above.</p>

<p><b>Inspections/Peer Reviews: </b>During the course of your project,
you will often review products created by other team members. In these
situations, it is very common for several people to find the same
defect. If you were to enter these defects using the method described
above, the dashboard would not be able to recognize the duplicated
defects, and the defect would get counted twice. Because of this,
defects found during inspections should be handled differently:</p>

    <ul>

    <li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>Obtain a blank inspection form (your
    team should have a defined form explicitly for this purpose). As
    you review the product, make a note of each defect you find on the
    inspection form. (Of course, you should also be using the
    dashboard to track the time you spend reviewing the
    material.)</li>

    <li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>After you complete your review, it
    is common to have a meeting where you discuss the defects you
    found with other reviewers, and with the author of the product
    being reviewed. Take your completed inspection form with you to
    this meeting, so the scribe can create a consolidated list of all
    defects found. (If your team inspection process does not include
    such a meeting, you should instead send your list of defects to
    the author of the reviewed product. The author will be responsible
    for creating the consolidated list of defects.)</li>

    <li style='margin-top:12.0pt'>Once the author has a consolidated
    list of defects, they typically correct each defect found. As the
    author works through the list of defects, he or she should enter
    the defects into the dashboard using the method described above,
    and use the defect dialog to track the amount of time it takes to
    fix each defect. Some items found during the inspection may
    actually be more than one defect, and if so should be entered
    accordingly.</li>

    </ul>

<p>Your team should have a defined process for performing an
inspection, which you should follow even if it differs from the steps
described above. The person responsible for fixing the defects found
should also enter the defect data into the dashboard.</p>



<h2><a name="size"></a>Entering Size Data</h2>

<p>Size metrics are extremely valuable in the analysis of historical data and
the creation of future plans.  Accordingly, it is important to capture size
data on various artifacts as you complete them.</p>

<p>The first step is to measure the size. For software, the dashboard's
<a href="../../help/Topics/PostmortemAnalysis/LOCCounter.html">LOC
counter</a> can help with this task.</p>

<p>If your personal plan contains
<a href="EditWorkflows.html#highMaturityPersonal">high-maturity<a> planning
or PSP tasks, you can
<a href="../../help/Topics/Planning/UsingSizeEstimatingTemplate.html#postmortem">enter
the actual size</a> on the task's Plan Summary Form and/or Size Estimating
Template.</p>

<p>For other components and tasks, you can enter size data by opening the
WBS Editor and entering values on the Actual Size tab.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/indiv-size-wbs.png"></p>

<p>You can enter values in more than one size column for a given item.
For example, the image above shows an actual size of 3 SDD pages, 12 Test
Cases, and 234 lines of code for component C1.  You can also enter actual
sizes on parent components and their children. The image above shows 3
SDD pages for component C1, 2 for component C2, and an additional SDD
page for the parent Component C (for a total of 6 pages overall).</p>

<p>It best to capture and enter size data as you work.  But if you forgot
to enter the size of some component, you can go back and enter it later
(and even if the project is finished).  If needed, you can also enter
size data for components written by other team members.</p>

<h3>Entering Size Data on Older Projects</h3>

<p>On older projects (created with Process Dashboard 2.5 and earlier),
the WBS Editor will not allow you to edit the values on the Actual Size
tab.  For those projects, you'll need to enter actual size data on the
Project Size Inventory Form.  You can open this form by selecting a task
within the project, clicking the script button, and choosing "Project
Size Inventory" from the menu:</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/indiv-scripts-size-inventory.png"></p>

<p>The Size Inventory form will be displayed in your Web browser.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/indiv-size-inventory.png"></p>

<p>Some entries may already appear in your size inventory; when you
synchronized your work breakdown structure, this information was
copied from the team plan. If you find an existing entry for a
document you have created, you can enter a description of the
document, along with the actual finished size of the document. If the
size changes due to edits in the future, you can return to this form
and alter the actual size value.</p>

<p>You can also create new entries in this size inventory form using
the hyperlinks that appear at the bottom of the page. Make certain to
enter a description, choose the appropriate size units, and enter
planned and actual sizes for each new entry.</p>

<p>You will note that the Size Units field includes options for LOC
and various types of documents. If you create a document, you should
pick the size metric that best describes that document. In the Actual
field, enter the number of pages that you personally wrote. If several
people wrote sections of a particular document, each person should
make an entry in their Size Inventory form describing the sections
that they wrote and the sizes of those sections. (You can use the
Description field to describe the specific section of the document
that you wrote.)  Only enter a value in the Actual field describing
portions of the document that <i>you</i> produced - do not enter
values describing document pages written by other team members.</p>



<h2><a name="pps"></a>Reviewing Project Metrics</h2>

<p>Project planning summary reports are available for all of the work
you do on your project. You can open these plan summaries by clicking
the dashboard Script button.</p>

<p>PSP tasks in your project hierarchy will provide familiar project
plan summary forms, as defined by the PSP process.</p>

<p>In addition, a plan summary form is provided that displays your
consolidated personal data for the entire project.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/indiv-plan-summary.png"></p>

<p>This form contains an initial set of charts and reports that you
may find useful.  However, you can customize this report to add other
charts, reports, and metrics: just click the (<img
src="../Images/icon-cms-edit.gif">) icon near the top of the page.  In
addition, you can drill down into a different part of your project
hierarchy by clicking on the (<img src="../Images/icon-hier-nav.png">)
icon.</p>
