<h1>Refining your Personal Project Plan (Team Member)</h1>

<p>With the team project launch complete, your dashboard will contain
a list of project tasks for you to perform. These tasks appear
underneath the team project in your dashboard hierarchy.</p>

<p>As you work on the project, your understanding of these tasks will
grow, and you may need to alter your original plan. If you discover
that a task is much larger or smaller than originally anticipated, you
can change the estimate for the task by clicking on the Percent Spent
indicator.  (This is the blue or red bar that appears to the right of
the play/pause button.)  You can also edit time estimates by opening
your earned value task &amp; schedule plan, and changing the numbers
in the PT (Planned Time) column. </p>

<p>Of course, it is also common to discover new tasks that need to be
performed and changes to existing tasks.  If you just need to create a simple
task, you can click the 
<a href="../../help/Topics/Execution/AddTaskButton.html">Add Task button</a>
on the main dashboard toolbar.  If you need to rename a task, move a task,
subdivide a task, delete a task, create a component, or use a team workflow,
click the script button and choose Work Breakdown Structure Editor.</p>

<p class="figure"><img src="../Images/indiv-scripts-wbs.png"></p>

<p>You can make changes to the tasks in the <a
href="EditingTheWBS.html">Work Breakdown Structure</a>, and when you
save the changes they will appear in your personal plan.</p>

<p>If your team is using <a href="TeamConfigDirCloud.html">cloud
storage</a> for team data, make sure your cloud provider's sync client
is running and active.  Your WBS changes will not be fully saved until
the sync client reports that all files are published and
up-to-date.</p>

<p>Some team leaders may choose to lock down the work breakdown
structure. In that case, you may be able to look at the Work Breakdown
Structure, but will not be able to make changes. If so, you may need
to ask your team leader or planning manager to make changes on your
behalf.</p>
